# Tariffs cancelled
I'm down 20% from my March highs after Trump paused tariffs.

I got giddy. I was so convinced that Trump was willing to tank markets that I sold everything before April 9th.

The result? Missing out on thousands of dollars, and not recovering any of my losses hitherto. 

I'm generally a risk taker. But I didn't expect things to play out like this. It simply didn't make sense. 

Why would Trump push so hard on this issue and stomach bad press just to back out at the last second? Negotiation technique? Did they even make deals with any countries?

Luckily I closed my bitcoin short, but I'm deeply unhappy with the outcome of this market dump.

If I had bought calls, I could have made 20x within a day.

In future, I will create more detailed theses with valid premises, and look at these every time I see a new "take" online.

In some sense, I had belief that the market would go down after I sold, but in another sense, I did believe price was very low. I'm just unhappy that I didn't predict this. What was the game plan?

##  The medium-term 
Despite Trump cancelling the broad, insane tariffs 

There is one thing he cannot control. Business cycles.

Is this fake? Are the several recession indicators fake? 

This is what we will examine in this article, and some plays we can make to capitalize on it.

Put things into perspective.

## Economy 
The last meaningful recession we had was in 2008, AKA the 2008 financial crisis / subprime mortgage crisis.

Since then, we've had a recession in 2020, largely offset by the Fed's actions. 

> Indeed, cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratios have elevated to near all time highs, with the last in 2000.

## Interest rates

## Short plays

### Ethbtc and alts over btc / alt shorts
p1: Altcoins cannot survive a recession

> ETH and all other L1s are going to near zero in a global recession. This is not debatable or even a close call because all L1s have 3 use cases:
> 1) shitty unregulated casino (recessionary value: $0) 
> 
> 2) NK fraud conduit (value: negative) 
> 
> 3) Stablecoin payment rail (current protocol value: $0)
> 
> Use case 3 is massive and growing. $100T USD+++ is a lock. But it returns nothing except a tiny, value agnostic gas fee, which goes *down* with the price of the token and L2 offramping.  
> 
> The solution is anathema to devs, but it will come anyway: a transfer tax.   
> An .001% fee on stablecoin xfers ($100 / 1M USD), shared 50% to stakers of the L1 it originated on & 50% to L2s if applicable, would have generated $2.7b between all protocols last year. Returned to stakers as a dividend, it would've been a massive flywheel.  It'll happen.  


This is becoming more apparent with price action.

Ethbtc hasn't even touched its 2021 highs despite bitcoin reaching over 100k in price.

Clearly, btc has a moat that other crypto-assets don't:

1. scarcity
2. mainstream adoption

As such, although btc is as much of an asset with no intrinsic value like that of altcoins, will not go down as much as other crypto-assets.

p2: eth usecase is virtually nonexistent

regardless of price, eth as a platform is fundamentally dying. It bears high fees, is being outcompeted by solana, lacking in innovation, and is still inflationary.
perhaps this is a change of tune from my prior stances, namely views that eth would outperform the rest of the altcoins. Indeed, I was bullish on eth, but this was because it was doing so badly 
and I believed a rotation was justified. Things are much different now, with a recession / most significant macro risk we've experienced in over a decade.

I may also try pair trades if there is risk re. time horizon. 

Notice that a spike in vix affirms an existing btc downtrend, but signifies total collapse for altcoins. They simply cannot survive in these environments, being so risk-on.

Also, unlike 2021, market participants understand that altcoins are a game of "greater fools", and so naturally sell-offs are becoming more aggressive.

### A note on selection
What I may try is finding the weakest alts relative to btc, and shorting a basket of them (law of large numbers) when macro looks to fall.


> most alts dont exactly seem to be in a great spot, pretty bearish sol too tbh
> too many alts at days end
> good proxy could be btc dominance, has behaved very differently to everything else this yr especially
> obv btc in downtrend for a while now, so not strictly bullish, but not full bear mkt mode for btc unlike rest of crypto

### A note on timing
As many have said, the macro situation isnt good, and vix is high for a reason. It's difficult to predict.
However, 

The most important thing is timing. If I think spx is going to top, and it rips 2-3%, I may be liquidated. It's very important that I find the time where risk assets are "not seeing"
the downside, like when P/Es go high despite recession.

There is going to be some moment where potential downside is again huge, and where shorting is high ev. Then, I'll deposit some money for a 50k ethbtc short.

> Looking at previous dumps, spx would go down 5% for example, starting a panic but not an overwhelming fear, followed by a larger candle, which would also tank btc and other crypto-assets. 
> Consider dumps in Aug 2024 and Mar 2020 for example. Perhaps bitcoin can show some resilience at the start of some macro weakness, but ultimately it will fall flat on its face 
> once a significant panic occurs.

### A note on sizing
Re. sizing, holding 3.3k in my account and leveraging 10x would allow me to control 33k usd worth of eth with a liq 10% higher than my entry.

In this case, I'd have to be super sure of an equity top, and I haven't been so good on this so far.

Upside is ~40%, so 0.4*33k usd = 13.2k
Perhaps I could also size up on some puts at this point that's a better bet than leverage short.

Re-thought;
a pair trade on ethbtc would be better. it has similar return to a naked eth long, without as much liq risk. if my thesis is correct, it is highly unlikely that this trade loses money.
btc is no longer in its hyper-speculative phase. it may not drop 30% in a day like in 2021 anymore.

w/ more cad, I can go ~5k usd at 10x = 50k usd, >25k profit possible.


### Companies
#### Tesla
Tesla is facing pressure due to:
1. Elon's association with the current administration
2. Current tariffs, along with future possible tariffs
3. Recession, consumer sentiment reducing demand for Tesla products
4. Recession, disproportionately affecting growth / high PE stocks 



### Options strategies
Unless confidence is very high, imo there is no point of putting on longer term options trades at high IV.

It's a tricky environment - you're betting on the economic situation to worsen when it is already priced in.

Could try some puts however, this seems the most logical to me. Set down premium on a high beta stock with asymmetric downside, and buy puts. 
Loss is finite and gain is significant, perhaps 3-4x depending on how the stock moves. IV will also spike, further increasing put values. this makes the most sense to me.

### Possible entries
China / US tariff negotiations are at the forefront of the market right now. Who will back down? Who will succeed?

In any case, consumer sentiment should go down. This will be good for a recession bet.


### Further thoughts

If you think about it, options' value is not about if the stock will reach x by whatever date, but rather, how the probabilities for each
price are mapped for each date. 

If the stock price needs an average of -2% every day to breakeven on an otm put, think to yourself, what kind of environment are we in, 
and what events are going on, where is macro, where is industry, FCF adjusted revenue growth, ect.

then rigorously analyze the possibilities and enter your trade. I'm sure I can do very well for myself if I genuinely study this and 
continue to place +EV trades. We can't go back now.

Think back to the distribution, and rigorously analyze each premise. 

I made money on apple because IV was cheap and its relative performance was staggeringly bad.

No one was in that trade at the time, no overcrowding, I didn't solicit advice from anyone else, ect.

I had my thesis, I bought my low-delta calls, and I made some money.
