The countless hours staring at charts
Options tools, tens of thousands of lines of code.
Losing tens of thousands of dollars within days at 18 years old

What was it all for?

If we cannot predict the market to generate concentrated, thesis-driven +EV bets, what is the point of doing anything?

## The final trade
Short tesla.

The definition of a gamma squeeze is when option call buying gets so high, market makers are forced to buy the stock to hedge against their call positions, thereby increasing the stock.
After OpEx, the market makers no longer need to hedge against outstanding short call options, so they in turn sell the stock.

If the stock declines into opex, it means that people are bearish on the stock, most likely decreasing call values and increasing put values, making market makers sell stock to hedge against puts sold.

Hence, a stock declining into opex marks a continuation of the blow-off top, i.e. downside.

## Economic data

- PCE increased by 0.1% - inflation slowing, fed permission to cut
- Continuing jobless claims are ticking higher, meaning more people are finding it difficult to get jobs.
- Waller has said that CEOs have told him that they aren't hiring, but waiting to see if the impact from tariffs will require layoffs.
- Personal spending is up by 0.2%, a meagre amount compared to before.

> Seeing a lot of excitement about the strength in personal income growth through April (+0.8% m/m, sa).
> The details of the report should temper that enthusiasm.
> While growth in employee compensation and small business owner incomes were solid through April, the recent surge in income has come from transfer receipts (i.e. payments to individuals from the government and businesses).
