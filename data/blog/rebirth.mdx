A few weeks ago, I finally recovered all of the money I lost from gambling hitherto. 

The initial feeling of making a lot of money within a leveraged trade was nice, but what was better, was the aftermath - this sense of gratitude I felt to myself, markets, god, 

for making it back.

It was worth it. 

# Mistakes made P1

Looking back on it, most of the returns I made during trading "segments" were

1. Stock market plays
2. Leveraged crypto bets
3. Mention markets on polymarket

The worst net losses were on:
1. political Polymarket bets (VP, Republican primary, ect.)
2. mention market Polymarket bets
3. financial Polymarket bets

Notice a pattern? I largely failed at prediction markets.
Even to date, I'm sitting at tens of thousands of dollars in losses on Polymarket.

# Rebirth

My hitrate on the stock market has been exceptional. My AAPL, LULU and SMCI plays have returned ~200%, 30%, and 100% respectively. Lulu was an unfortunate case, as I was influenced by a friend to sell my 
shares before their positive earnings reports. I was also scared by Nike and similar consumer cyclical stocks.

## Portfolio rebalancing
I've begun withdrawing all of the money I made from trading off of hyperliquid. Never have I ever been so profitable in futures trading before. I would have liked to do the same thing with the stock market,
but obviously I can't find a broker for 10x leverage.

**New portfolio: ~75/25 Equities/Polymarket bets**

## Equity market plays
Portfolio management is difficult. 
I'll probably engage in the following strategies:

1. Long/short leveraged equity indices
2. Call option "bets" with <= 10% of the portfolio on each trade
3. Long term equity holdings
