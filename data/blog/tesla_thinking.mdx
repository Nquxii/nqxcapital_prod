# Tesla thinking - premise-based logical structure

### July 18th 2025

- Tesla went up 167.4% since it's August lows in one of its largest rallies throughout the history of the company.
This was due to Elon Musk's massive political donations to Trump, signifying a more favorable regime for the company
less regulation on FSD, freedom from DOJ / SEC probes, govt contracts with tesla ect.

- Tesla went down ~50% after its Dec high. This is because of brand damage with Elon (DOGE) being associated with Trump, which lead to poor sales across the globe. Additionally, the broader market (SPY) went down 12%.

- Since then, Tesla has made many attempts to reach its highs, most notably the run after the April 9 "Liberation Day" lows, where it climbed up
70.13% from its lows.

- Tesla experienced a significant down-day since then, due to the public deterioration of the Trump-Elon relationship

- Tesla experienced another few up-days after the long-awaited robotaxi event, which felt like a mania-fueled buying spree
from retail investors. 

- Afterwards, it quickly retraced in price and dove 6%, after renewed Elon-Trump fighting.

- Now, it has recovered from the lows post-fight narrative, but it is back at a lower high awaiting its earnings report on July 23rd.

From this alone, we can conclude one thing. Fundamentals don't matter.
If they did, Tesla's current price would be closer to when it had no brand damage and Elon had no relationship with Trump (August lows).

## View
**I expect a ~20-30% decline in the price of Tesla over the next 2 months. **

Why? 

- Logically, there is no reason or "narrative" for Tesla's price to climb higher here.
    - Musk has ruled off a Tesla-xAI merger, making any AI-related speculation impossible
    - Musk has publicly fought with Trump online, repeatedly (~40 actions on twitter) insinuating that he is a pedophile (note, this is causing significant disarray in the Trump admin, as the populist voterbase becomes angry)
    - Tesla is losing important government subsidies: ZEV regulatory credits and the consumer EV tax credit(JPMorgan estimates a loss of ~45% of 2024 EBIT, or $3.2b)
    - US Tariffs on battery material will increase costs and shrink profit margins for Tesla (https://x.com/DeItaone/status/1945898364626751811)
    - US Tariffs on other countries have risk to the upside, which could result in retalitory tariffs and/or anti-American sentiment (which would decrease purchases of American cars in general, especially Tesla due to aforementioned reasons!)
    - Competition in China is heating up, with competitors such as Xiaomi and BYD releasing cheaper, superior alternatives (e.g. YU7, and BYD in europe:https://www.jato.com/resources/media-and-press-releases/byd-outsells-tesla-in-europe-for-the-first-time-as-registrations-surge-in-april)
- Macro / economic situation is worsening
    - Inflation may be reigniting, with Trump's tariffs increasing inflation estimates from the Fed
    - Rates may be held steady as a result, again shocking demand for growth assets
    - NFPs are slowly declining, as given by low private-sector hiring (it is a slow-to-hire, slow-to-fire labor mkt rn, but subject 2 change)
    - Trump has repeatedly indicated that he will put tariffs on other countries (his plan needs an entire segment alone, but we 
    should expect him to implement at least *some* of the promised tariffs: https://www.tradecomplianceresourcehub.com/2025/07/17/trump-2-0-tariff-tracker/)
- Technicals don't make sense
    - If we considered Tesla as an AI / Robotics bet, it would be correlated to other stocks (like NVIDIA/SMCI)
    - Tesla's performance is largely uncorrelated at this point, and is based on speculative inflows
    - Once robotaxi released, we saw a large 10% spike in price, which retraced immediately, *prior* to more Elon comments re. Trump
    - Think of it. If you were long tesla as a speculative, hype bet, why on earth hasn't it pumped since its late-May highs? 
    - Note that volatility was significantly higher during the 2020-2022 Tesla price squeezes, which led to significant pumps throughout.
    - It appears now that TSLA is simply not a proxy for previous narratives anymore.
    - Clearly it wasn't Elon and Trump fighting that led to lower prices. It was a lack of demand for tesla at those prices.
    - Hence, I am really unsure as to how bulls think Tesla will pump significantly, breaking its recent high of ~366.
    - There were fewer problems with Tesla when it was going up vertically in December 2024, compared to now.

### Volatility
Note that the realized volatility of Tesla has dropped since its May highs.

This indicates that we are in a different regime now - one more based on fundamentals than volatile price spikes

If there are no buyers willing to push price up quickly, this further increases the confidence in my thesis that Tesla's run is coming to an end.

Not only as an unprofitable company, but as a speculation vehicle. Realized volatility was higher during all other price runs in Tesla history.

When it behaves like a normal tech company, it is further indication that it will trade less on gamma squeezes, and more on fundamentals.

### In summary
I understand $TSLA as a speculative bet. What I don't understand is how someone thinks we're going to break local highs when we've already
had several high-hype opportunities to do so. I believe $TSLA earnings may give the market a chance to re-evaluate its pricing
on tesla, and that Trump's tariffs will cause further decline for the broader market.


## Appropriate investment vehicles to capitalize on this
The best, best way to capitalize this, is by using $TSLA as a short hedge.
This way, if macro or broader-market problems arise, tesla will fall further than its peers / the market, because it isn't in a position
to benefit from a shift to value or high FCF-generating companies. In uncertain environments, growth companies like tesla are discounted
more.
