I'm starting to like this format way more than my obsidian pages, because the latter is terrible for editing w/ Vim.

Currently figuring out formatting, which will be used for future "thesis" pages.

# Introduction
Meta is trading for ~23x trailing earnings right now (02 Feb 2026), whereas virtually every other MAG7 stock was at least in the low 30s
a few weeks ago.

This would be fine if meta didn't have 27% revenue growth and wasn't guiding for 30% revenue growth next quarter.

Issue is, apparently, AI capex spend.

However, this contradicts the broader market sentiment, since every major tech company is spending insane amounts of CapEX
on AI.

## Technical analysis / vibes
Meta's stock has been essentially flat for the last 365 days.

Given that earnings have been growing significantly, this is very unheard of for a MAG7 stock.

This isn't a 2022-type situation where a cyclical downturn in the economy is compressing valuations.

It's a magic copium oscillator, now at its peak.

## CapEX and Funnymentals
Projected >130b CapEX at peak range this year.

Capex just improves their moat, and in the long run if revenue + watchtime + DAUs increase, which is 
quite likely considering AI's effect on advertising + impressions growth (which we are already seeing !)

it's probably fine.

- reels watch time up 30%
- +18% FY YoY impressions on 9% YoY FY ad price increase
- guiding for 30% YoY revenue growth next qtr

> The company generated earnings well above consensus estimates and beat revenue by about 1.3 billion, while providing forward guidance ahead of analysts' expectations. Most of the performance can be attributed to advertising, which rose approximately 24% year over year. Meta has invested significantly in AI to enhance its advertising business, and the moves appear to be working.

> In a recent memo, Meta said it doubled the number of graphics processing units (GPUs) used to train the company's ads ranking model. The purpose is to better choose the ads that align with audience interests. Meta also uses an AI business assistant to help companies improve their advertising campaigns and reach account support.


Seems like GEM model + algos seem to be improving, both improving impressions and increasing price per ad at the 
same time, which is a bullish combo.

q1 2025 revenue was `42.31` billion
q1 2026 guidance is `53.5-56.5` billion
Revenue growth range: approximately 26.5% to 33.5%.

Comps:
Per Grok,
Here’s a summary of the latest available Q1 2026 guidance (or nearest equivalent) for each:

- Apple (AAPL): Fiscal Q1 2026 (ended Dec 2025) was already reported with record revenue of ~143.8B (up 16% YoY). For the next quarter (fiscal Q2 2026, calendar Q1 2026), guidance was revenue growth of 13–16% YoY (implying ~107.8B–110.7B). They noted constrained iPhone supply.
- Microsoft (MSFT): Fiscal Q1 2026 (Jul–Sep 2025) reported; for fiscal Q2 2026 (Oct–Dec 2025, reported earlier), they guided revenue 79.5B–80.6B (14–16% growth), with Azure ~37–38% constant currency growth. No explicit calendar Q1 2026 (Jan–Mar) guidance found in recent reports, but ongoing cloud/AI strength was highlighted (supply constraints expected to persist into mid-2026).
- Nvidia (NVDA): Fiscal Q1 2026 (Feb–Apr 2025) reported earlier; later quarters (e.g., fiscal Q3 2026 ended Oct 2025) showed record revenue ~57B. No specific calendar Q1 2026 guidance in the results, but full-year fiscal 2026 outlook included operating expense growth in mid-30% range amid strong data center demand (some export limitations impacted).
- Amazon (AMZN): For calendar Q1 2026, guidance from Feb 2026 report: net sales 173.5B–178.5B (11–15% YoY growth, including ~180 bps FX tailwind). Operating income 16.5B–21.5B (includes higher costs for projects like Amazon Leo). They also guided ~200B capex for full-year 2026.
- Alphabet (GOOGL/GOOG): No explicit Q1 2026 revenue guidance in recent reports (focus was on full-year 2026 capex of 175B–185B, up significantly for AI infrastructure). Cloud backlog was strong (~240B), with expectations for continued growth, but no quarterly range provided.


Also, I don't believe "CapEX" is even a real narrative. Every mag7 is dumping billions into capex, and their
valuations are much higher. 

Companies like AAPL demand a P/E of ~35 right now, despite 13-15% projected YoY growth (and operating in a lower-growth industry)

It's all about narrative, not some nonsense fundamental number dragging down valuation.

As I previously mentioned,
If top line growth wasn't as good, I'd be more skeptical about capex. That would be more alike a metaverse situation.

## Narrative 
I don't see why META deserves such a low P/E. They have a lot of exposure to the future. 

[Meta glasses are up 3x in sales YoY](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/ray-ban-maker-essilorluxottica-triples-sales-of-meta-ai-glasses.html), 
Reality labs projects are in their infancy but rapidly improving

They'll benefit from AI-gneerated content immensely, as more addictive content ~= higher watchtime.

Not many can compete in this area, aside from TikTok.

## Parallels 

Remember when GOOGL hit a ~18 P/E because of the antitrust lawsuit? and "AI fears"

Then doubled in just over 100 trading days?

Ultimately, they kept up their revenue and iterated on Gemini enough to be a leading player.

the stock was basically flat (no new aths) from Jul 2024 to Aug 2025. (~400d) Then it rallied 80%.

META, made aths in Feb 2025, and hasn't made big ATHs since, over a frivolous, contradictory narrative.

I feel like meta, having such explosive growth, and traditionally being the more high-growth company in the MAG7 
(from last cycle iirc), I think we get the same this cycle. META will become one of the most high P/E Companies
in the mag7 before the "business cycle" ends.

# Instruments

## General idea
I want to best capture the 3-6mo performance from here. Although the broader market is tumbling right now, I feel
like Apr 2025 with $GOOGL, Meta will bounce back the hardest. 

I'm confused by the macro situation, though. So I might need to buy longer term calls.

## Portfolio allocation
Everything.

## Holdings
> META May 15 690C @ 49.30
>
> META June 18 685C @ 59.75
> 
> META June 18 660C @ 72.90
> 
> META June 18 690C @ 31.50
> 
> META June 18 700C @ 43.10

all ATM / OTM calls with ~4mo until expiry.
Since I expect QQQ to rally eventually, and beta to follow, this provides ample time for a big rally.

## Updates
- Reduced May 15 690C's at ~15% loss. Market seems to be undergoing a volatile period, cooking price / theta.

Thinking of rolling my calls to a further date, or selling and waiting for bigger drops in the first qtr this yr.
