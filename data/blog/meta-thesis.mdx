I didn't feel like writing about anything else (was thinking about writing about market cycles or my poor decision making
during Apr 2025)

I'm starting to like this format way more than my obsidian pages, because the latter is terrible for editing w/ Vim.

I also think iterating on yourself as a market participant is highly dependent on remembering principles / past events.

# Meta thesis

Meta is trading for ~23x earnings right now (02 Feb 2026), whereas virtually every other MAG7 stock was at least in the low 30s
a few weeks ago.

This would be fine if meta didn't have 27% revenue growth and wasn't guiding for 30% revenue growth next quarter.

Issue is, apparently, AI capex spend.

However, this contradicts the broader market sentiment, since every major tech company is spending insane amounts of CapEX
on AI.

# Technical analysis / vibes
Additionally, meta's stock has been essentially flat for the last 365 days.

Given that earnings have been growing significantly, this is very unheard of for a MAG7 stock.

This isn't a 2022-type situation where cyclical downturn in the economy is compressing valuations.

It's a magic copium oscillator, now at its peak.

# CapEX and Funnymentals
Projected >130b at peak range this year.

Capex just improves their moat, and in the long run if revenue + watchtime + DAUs increase, which is 
quite likely considering AI's effect on advertising + impressions growth (which we are already seeing !)

it's probably fine.

>reels watch time up 30%
>+18% FY YoY impressions on 9% YoY FY ad price increase
>guiding for 30% YoY revenue growth next qtr

Seems like GEM model + algos seem to be improving, both improving impressions and increasing price per ad at the 
same time, which is a bullish combo.

Also, I don't believe "CapEX" is even a real narrative. Every mag7 is dumping billions into capex, and their
valuations are much higher. 

Companies like $AAPL demand a P/E of ~35 right now, despite 13-15% projected YoY growth (and operating in a lower-growth industry)

It's all about narrative, not some nonsense fundamental number dragging down valuation.

If top line growth wasn't as good, I'd be more skeptical about capex. That would be more alike a metaverse situation.

# Parallels 

Remember when $GOOGL hit a ~18 P/E because of the antitrust lawsuit? and "AI fears"

Then doubled in just over 100 trading days?

Ultimately, they kept up their revenue and iterated on Gemini enough to be a leading player.

the stock was basically flat (no new aths) from Jul 2024 to Aug 2025. (~400d) Then it rallied 80%.

META, made aths in Feb 2025, and hasn't made big ATHs since, over a frivolous, contradictory narrative.

I feel like meta, having such explosive growth, and traditionally being the more high-growth company in the MAG7 
(from last cycle iirc), I think we get the same this cycle. META will become one of the most high P/E Companies
in the mag7 before the "business cycle" ends.

# Instruments

> META May 15 690C @ 49.30
> META June 18 685C @ 59.75
> 
> META June 18 660C @ 72.90
> META June 18 690C @ 31.50
> META June 18 700C @ 43.10

all ATM / OTM calls with ~4mo until expiry.
Since I expect QQQ to rally eventually, and beta to follow, this provides ample time for a big rally.

## Updates
Reduced May 15 690C's. Market seems to be undergoing a volatile period, cooking price / theta.
