### Disclamer

a few days before the election, I decided to sell all of my margin of victory bets on Trump. I felt that my position was too large (~30% of my portfolio), and a lot of 
popular bettors held the opinion that Kamala would win. Ultimately, I missed out on a gain of ~120% of my portfolio at the time.

In hindsight, I should have followed my intuition. My "theory" that Biden 2020 would outperform Kamala was correct. The polls completely psyop'd me. I'd explain in a later post, but I will probably be
too depressed to talk about it again.

Since Biden dropped out of the US presidential race in July 2024, I always found it confusing that pundits, along with most democrats, believed Kamala Harris would fare *significantly* better than biden, enough to win her the race.

In fact, most people vehemently disagreed with this notion, until Biden was in fact thrown out of the race.

Harris, in her time as VP, was hardly known and often seen as a "DEI hire". Biden saying he would choose a black woman as VP after becoming nominee in 2020 does not subdue this narrative.

At her core, I believe she is a puppet. Like Hillary Clinton, but more favourable. She has sidestepped so many issues this election, like border security and Biden's unfavorable term.
Additionally, she has made few public appearances and said the same thing at every rally.

Meanwhile, Trump's personal qualities are diminishing as he is aging, and his strategy is to paint Kamala is the greater evil and a radical-left, incompetent candidate.

### My thesis on Aug 3, 2024:

I'm currently 60/40 Trump (I think it'll be hard for KH to move the needle enough in every swing state)
My general thinking is that Kamala will fail to convert her strength in the polls to votes on election day

There are a number of reasons for this:
- Polling has historically been democrat-biased
- Trump outperformed the polls in 2016 and 2020, indicating that his turnout may be stronger than other candidates'
- The [Bradley effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect) may overrepresent Harris' strength due to social desirability bias (I doubt the validity of this, but Harris is both a woman and a POC, and identity politics are more prominent now, so it may be more relevant)
- Harris' policy is not that different from Biden's AFAIK, and their approval ratings are similar, so unenthusiastic dems may be feigning support for her in the polls without any intention to actually vote for her

If KH runs a good campaign, picks a unifying VP, and secures broader appeal, I can see her winning this election. 


Otherwise, it'll be an uphill road, as issues that plague her campaign will decrease turnout. Trump already has a strong base and has been establishing his policy for years now. 
His preference for dovish fiscal policy may come to light now that rate cuts are on the table before the election and the stock market is erasing its gains. 
If he successfully portrays KH as an incompetent radical (or in another negative light), his turnout will win him this election. 
Hence, KH should be careful to not be viewed negatively by independents and swing state voters, and run a meaningful campaign.

### What's changed
Frankly, not much. Harris has not done anything significant to maintain a lead over Trump. Despite showing strong poll numbers during the DNC, when she was nominated, it is very clear that
her support and facade is falling apart.

**Fundamentally, there is no reason to believe Trump's polling numbers *aren't overstated*.**

In 2020, Biden won each swing state by a very thin margin. His polling, however, had him winning each state handily. 

Take a look at [Trump vs Biden battleground state polls in 2020](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/elections/trump-vs-biden-top-battleground-states/).

Poll overstated Biden's support by 6 points in Wisconsin, 1.2 points in NC, 4.1 points in Florida, 1.5 points in Michigan, and 0.6 points in Arizona.

I am curious if anyone thinks Harris has a *higher* favorability or general chance of winning the election compared to Biden. 

In 2020, various conditions allowed Biden to push a favourable narrative - COVID, BLM Protests, the crumbling (then in recovery) economy, ect.

Yet, he underperformed significantly compared to his polling.

Today, we have a candidate that is :

- *already a part* of the current administration, yet was still largely unknown.
- A minority, which makes her polling suceptible to the Bradley effect.
- Polling significantly worse than Biden in every key state
- Ignored public apperances 
- Polling worse than her opponent on most key issues, such as the economy

These factors help Trump significantly, as voters are motivated to vote for a candidate they believe will bring change.

Harris, however, has largely failed to articulate her plans (especially in an economic sense), and differentiate herself from Biden

in this sense, I think her turnout numbers are overstated. Given aforementioned factors, it is unlikely that polls are biased against Trump.

Trump's support has always been inelastic and hard to move, and therefore strong in terms of turnout (as his base is stronger on average)

## Bets
On polymarket, it doesn't make sense to bet on Trump to win the election (on the main market). Odds are now 60/40, so betting on Trump yields 40/60 = 66.6%.
Given how close we are to the election, and how polarized non-swing state polling is (e.g. VA), 
I think the best bet to get exposure to a Trump win is betting on the GOP to win by 65-104.

Although this bet is currently priced at 29c (~4x if it hits), and is largely low EV at this point,
This bet provides a large return in the event of a swing state sweep by Trump - which has happened in the last 2 elections.

If Trump does in fact materialize a broad shift *towards* the GOP, it's unlikely that one or two states vote for Harris. Indeed, Trump only won Michigan by 0.23% in 2016, 
but electoral shifts are highly favoring Trump right now, with 

but early voting in Nevada favors trump so 

There are some risks to betting on a swing state sweep, however, which I'll detail in the following:

Case 1: 
- NC/GA shifts left, disrupting the electoral college sweep (this is especially true for NC due to Mark Robinson scandal) 
- I think this is unlikely, georgia polling is inelastic and broad shifts against Harris are apparent in polls.

Case 2:
- Swing states don't vote for one candidate uniformly (e.g. Rust belt and Sun belt split up)
- Also unlikely, hasn't happened in the last 2 elections, but states like Michigan and Wisconsin have been very left in the polls.

Case 3:
- Trump loses the election
- I guess this is the most likely, and a worrying outcome to some degree, if Harris manages to perform better than Biden.
