My strategy is insanely risky, involving very concentrated leveraged bets and strong psychological discipline.

It's gotten to the point where I don't even like talking to people about it... because my entire life is on a single bet.

I've lost ~70% of my portfolio several times, with my worst drawdown being in 2024 (lost 78% of portfolio from peak to trough)

In terms of gains up till now, I am a bit over my starting amount (I think about 150% NW increase accounting for expenses)

No tweets, little discussion, ect. I rarely even talk about specific investments when the stock market comes up with someone.

I'll just tell them to invest in diversified portfolio of index funds, bank stocks, dividend stocks, ect.

**Why choose a risky strategy?**

Because I'm poor. There's no point in making small $$ compound for now, until I get a job.

That'd be like 50,000*1.13^3

I'm not doing this for pennies. Also, fundamentally, I believe that there are very few opportunities in the market,
and that when you find one, you should put as much capital as possible into it.
