When it comes down to it, fed interest rates are all about risk.

If the fed cut 25bps in September, would it induce risk to the economy - well, from their perspective, yes. Risks were to the downside - cutting by 25 would induce 
significant threat to the economy.

Now that we're in December, the fed has cut by 75bps already, and the economy hasn't seen significant price constraints. 

Every other country has cut by 25bps. Why would the US keep interest rates high. Although quickly cutting rates could pose a risk down the line, 


risks are to the upside.

Since the last rate cut in November, 
- inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2%
- nominal wage growth has eased
- labor market is not a source of significant inflation pressure
- core inflation is somewhat elevated
- if inflation progress does not continue, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly
- non housing services and goods are back at levels consistent with 2% core


All of this information indicates that the fed wants to cut slowly, unless inflation progress is even worse. We're seeing some small bumps in inflation, but nothing large.
So it seems appropriate to bet that powell will go 25bps. Stopping rate cuts here would indicate that inflation is high enough to stop cuts **at these interest rate levels**, which

meeting notes

> Powell: We do not need the economy to soften to get back to 2%

> Powell: **Even with today's cut, policy is still restrictive**

> Powell: As we approach a neutral rate, it may be appropriate to *slow* the pace of rate cuts

> Powell: [We are in the process of going towards the neutral rate]

""if we saw the labor market deteriorate, we'd be prepared to move more quickly. 
Alternatively, as we approach levels that are plausibly neutral, it may turn out to be appropriate to slow the pace at which we are dialing back

- we expect bumps in our journey to 2% inflation

- data from core pce, such as core housing inflation are reflective of leases that are turning over and "catching up" with market rent leases

- labor market is not a source of inflationary pressures. it's not a tight economy.

- catch up inflation in other areas like insurance 

- not declaring victory, but the story is **very consistent with inflation continuing to come down on a bumpy path over the next two years and settling around 2%**

    - note how he says 2 years. obviously he can't keep rates at 4.75% for two years without major economic contraction, and every economy is cutting rates right now.
    - most likely he'll cut 0.25% each time while monitoring changes in the market.

- not in a hurry to get to the neutral rate, so 50bps is off the table.

### Update and plan for remaining roi
Prices have now moved to 71c for yes based on comments from the fed. Fedwatchtool is even higher, at ~75%.

I was going to buy 70c yes for 25bps and wait until a possible NickiLeaks' article denial, but that's obviously very risky, and I'm not at 95%+ odds for a 25bps rate cut.

- Fed said 3% is the neutral rate, and that current policy is too restrictive.

- Job market is crumbling, inflation is "bumping" broadly moving down.

Book it.
