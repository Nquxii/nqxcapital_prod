My goal in creating this blog is to write about:

- Investment management
- Prediction markets & poltical betting
- Equity & crypto markets
- Useful mental models / advice
- Books
- Anecdotes, personal challenges

I chose to write about these in a blog as opposed to a personal medium (notes or whatever)
as it's the most organized (public domain) and thus keeps me accountable.

Also makes me delve deeper into topics and put more effort so as to not publish low-quality content.
