## Intro
Mention markets (MMs) on polymarket are perhaps the most psychologically demanding and lucrative markets on the platform.

This is because an individual's rhetoric is highly unpredictable, and waiting for them to mention something (or finish a speech without saying something) is very nerve-racking.

Additionally, most newcomers to these markets fail, because they lack the information to predict seemingly trival events (unlike experienced MM bettors).
This dynamic contributes to the "cannibalistic" 
aspect of these markets.

Over time, however, good bettors have enough information to **easily** profit from their bets in the long-run.

## Strategy
This is because speeches may be tailored to a specific political point. This may seem like a simple fact, and already 'priced-in', but Polymarket suffers badly from recency bias.

If Trump doesn't say something in one rally, it's likely that its mention market odds for the next rally will be very low. The opposite is true if Trump says something a lot.

The key is to make small bets with high extrinsic value.

By "small bets", I mean you should bet based on the kelly criterion, but 1/2 or 1/4th of the recommended amount. This will prevent you from [blowing up](/data/blog/blowing-up-the-single-most-important-hedge).

By "high extrinsic value", I mean to bet on something with asymmetric upside. A simple example is if a rally is purportedly focusing on the economy, bet against the speaker saying border-related topics.

Look at base rates to ensure the odds are well-priced in your favor. I won't say a lot about this - you need a way to accurately measure every previous mention of the word you're betting on.

### Examples, personal bets
The best example of a good bet I made on a mention market is on Trump's rally in Prarie Du Chen, Wisconsin.
Looking at the [press release](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/24f093a1-d3ed-4e1c-b58d-4975bc18d0cd), (which apparently nobody looks at), it was obvious that the speech would be limited to remarks on the border,

in addition to other current events, since Trump likes to ramble about those. 

You can also see that the stage that Trump was performing at was very small, in fact, he was speaking at an elementary school. This implies he does not have a large audience to rile up, so extreme rhetoric will
be avoided.

In light of this information, I bought a lot of NO shares on Trump saying "Tax Queen", for ~30c per share. I bought 3500 shares, for a total cost of ~$1000.

The price was trading at ~70/30 for Yes/No, since Trump said it in his last rally (his last appearance was about remarks on the tax code, which is why he said the term.)

## Dangers and ad-hoc narratives

The most common mistake I make *currently* as a bettor on mention market is bidding on markets with bad odds. Trump can say anything at a rally, you never know what comes on his mind.
Even if the base rates for a specific word are low, betting against him saying something for a high price is unwise. I made this mistake recently, in fact, betting against him saying "Vance".
He said it, and I lost $1000 since shares were going for 50c. (For context, he generally says "j.d." or doesn't mention him)

It's also important not to create ad-hoc narratives i.e. a contrived thesis. For example, if Trump is speaking at some event in Pennsylvania, more likely than not, his remarks will follow previous rallies.
There's no need to bet harder on things like the economy and the border at bad odds - as previously mentioned:

> there are tons of opportunities to profit in MMs. Don't waste your money and over-bet.

I've personally lost tons of money betting against Trump saying "transgender", because I placed value in where exactly he was making the rally, and in what setting, instead of considering the nature of the remark,
which is to rile up voters at the *end* of his rallies as part of his prepared teleprompter remarks.

These markets are competitive in nature; if you give out tips for free, markets will become more efficient and you will lose income opportunities.

In fact, I would argue that if newcomers or irrational bettors didn't exist, the odds would fall out of my favor and I would not be able to make any lucrative bets.


## Future of mention markets

After making ~$8000 from various bets on mention markets, I found that many veterans began to stop betting on them.
I guess it's because base rate bets kept failing and there was no empirical evidence that their strategy worked.

Whales on these markets, like [HaterzLoserz](https://polymarket.com/profile/0xe64ffa7621459172ad81960762d5760e65d444a5) and [anon1565](https://polymarket.com/profile/0x7bda5bceac127c3fc41d7fe7ac335593aaaa121b)
have stopped betting on them, at least right now, Oct 17 2024.

The viability of these markets will come into question throughout the next few months - will polymarket stop promoting them given how unfavorable they are to newcomers?
