For risk-on bettors:
When considering a bet,
1. First imagine what your portfolio would look life if the bet failed. Only then imagine what your portfolio would look like if the bet succeded. 
consider how much you would have to make in percentage terms to make your money back, for example, if you lose 50% then it'd take 100% roi from there to breakeven, which is very difficult.

(helps against prospect theory)

2. Understand that capital is scarce. Don't waste it on a bad opportunity. (kelly criterion and probability of blowing up even given a favorable bet)

3. Don't blindly copy-trade someone else. Do your own research before coming to conclusions. *Everyone* is biased, and they are not in the same financial position as you. Their prediction could be based on 
a variety of factors.

4. Forget about your assumptions. What should/is the descion maker think is what matters (trump+jre bet) 

5. Do not focus on your potential profit. Think of every bet in terms of *possible loss* given a **devised probability**. (helps against longshot bias)

6. "aggressive betting" is an easy shortcut to blowing up. do not bet a large percentage of your portfolio on a single bet. you can use a variation of the kelly criterion (consider mistake #2) to avoid this mistake.
