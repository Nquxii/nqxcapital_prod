# Homemade Milk Tea (Masala Chai)

A simple, warming milk tea you can customize to your taste.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup milk
* 2 teaspoons black tea leaves (or 2 tea bags)
* Fresh ginger (sliced or crushed)
* 2–3 cardamom pods (lightly crushed)
* 2–3 cloves
* Sugar (optional, to taste)

## Instructions

1. **Heat the milk**
   Pour the milk into a small pot and bring it to a gentle boil over medium heat (about 5 minutes). Stir occasionally to prevent it from sticking or burning.

2. **Add the tea**
   Once the milk begins to boil, add the black tea leaves or tea bags.

3. **Add the spices**
   Add ginger, cardamom, and cloves according to your preference. Lightly crushing the whole spices helps release more flavor.

4. **Simmer and watch the color**
   Let the mixture simmer for a few minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat once the tea reaches a rich, deep brown color.

5. **Strain and serve**
   Strain into a cup, sweeten if desired, and serve hot.

## Tips

* Don’t leave the spices in for too long — over-steeping can make the tea bitter or overly strong in cardamom or clove.
* For a stronger tea, simmer slightly longer; for a lighter tea, remove earlier.
* You can adjust the spice levels to make it more ginger-forward or more aromatic.

Enjoy your cup ☕
