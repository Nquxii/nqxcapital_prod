Over the past few months I've been pouring money into my old car without realizing. 

At first, it was just an exhaust leak and brakes. As time went on, I kept having to spend money on the car

depsite my family's hesitance to continue repairing the car, I kept doing it, and somehow due to an electronic issue, the car
remained in the same condition - a total headache and gas guzzler to drive.

My initial thought a few weeks back was that the maintenence was temporary and it'd go back to driving as usual very soon

but that wasn't the case - I had to put another $600 in just to *diagnose* the car, and I *still* haven't fixed the issue.

after calculating the repairs, I realized I put about $5,700 into the car without realizing it. It's an insane sum of money for a car that was originially worth ~$2k.

I could've bought other cars significantly better than what I had, but I didn't.

And now, I have much less money than I began with.

As Naval Ravikant once said, money solves your money problems, but it won't make you happy. It won't solve all of your problems, but it will solve your *money problems*

When you have money, try to think as if you had much less, and try and if you can, solve some of your money problems. 
Without percieving your "net worth" as a tangible resource, you'll always feel agony when you think about investments and what you once had (if you lose it).

Use money as a tool, not a number that represents your value. Buy things that you like from time to time. Solve your problems if you can.
