> Laugh, and the world laughs with you. Weep, and you weep alone. ~Korean proverb

Imagine a life - when you're in elementary school, young, everyone around you (schoolmates, family ect.) has the same goals as you.
Make it to the next day, learn the basics in life, ect.

It's like you are a part of a large family.

As you grow up, people become more envious, and not everyone has the same goals as you. I remember in high school, when my friends and I were competing for
grades to get accepted into university, things were much more competitive. Suddenly, what you did was judged as good or bad, and your failures were others' successes
at times.

Some people did well - they made good, smart friends, excelled academically, partied and had fun on the side, and ended up moving into university, which would be challenging, but manageable for them.

Others, however, didn't seek this path. Not to insult the viability of different paths, but these people generally did objectively worse than others.

A few people even went to jail, had their faces posted on the news. If you're one of these people, not relative to classmates/people you know, but society in general,  
you'll laugh with the world, your friends, colleagues, whatever. You'll wake up every day, get to work, . Maybe you save money, invest it, and manage to retire.
