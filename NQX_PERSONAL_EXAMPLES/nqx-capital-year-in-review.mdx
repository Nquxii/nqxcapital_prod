It's currently December 20th 2024. A short year, I'd say. Only in November 2023 did I start betting on polymarket, and it feels like I have a lot to learn, there were so many opportunities this year
that I was always waiting on something or pondering something.

I'm making this review post so I can look back on these memories in the future, and learn from my mistakes as I ended this year at a net loss.

## Beginning of Polymarket, +10% "sweet nectar"
The first trade I made was on the poly-market, "Will BTC hit $50,000 before Jan 31?"

My thesis was that the btc etf was a sell-the-news event, and that 50k was not going to happen. The odds were also good, at ~50/50.

I came out with a big profit, but in hindsight my bet was way too large as the downside would have been huge.

I think this bet also made me more risk-on, and caused my networth to implode, as I'll explain later in this post.


## Double or nothing, my successful primary bet
The second-most memorable trade this year, the Nikki Haley bet I made during the Republican primary.

My bet was that Nikki Haley, the well-funded "neoconservative" alternative to Trump, woud *not* drop out before Super Tuesday.

The thesis was simple - she had a very well funded campaign, and wouldn't back down to Trump after a successful New Hampshire primary win.

I had no knowledge of politics at this time - this is another point that led to various small losses throughout my betting career.

Odds were very good, about 37c for No, IIRC, since a big market maker was very bearish on Haley's prospects and likelihood of staying.

I liked this bet because the market maker in question was constantly coping on discord that Haley would drop out after South Carolina or even 

In hindsight, I got lucky on this bet - any other politician would've folded. However, there was some merit in the idea that Haley wanted to build a persona for herself 
and didn't care about her future political prospects as much. I mean - she served as UN Ambassador to the US in Trump's term, and was a Senator for ~6 years? She stood her ground
and genuinely believed that what she was running for was bigger than politics.

She got grilled by the RNC for her decision to stay in the primary, but she stood with her decision. She's admirable, frankly.

## Small losses on republican primaries
During Super Tuesday, I misinterpreted a headline suggesting that Haley won DC and that meant she won a state in the primary. Apparently, DC is not a state (according to the polymarket rules), and
I was in for thousands of dollars on Haley winning a primary.

I imagined that she may win Vermont, so I decided to sell some shares. Eventually, however, I became panicked and sold my shares at a loss *during* the primary.

This is because very few people held the opinion that Trump would lose any states. They most likely didn't see polling data from 2012 and 2016 which had Trump-like voters very low, and 
didn't account for the fact that Dems may have crossed party lines to vote Haley in the primary (consider also that their republican governor endorsed her).

I sold shares, enduring orderbook slippage, for no reason, since random people on twitter told me Trump would sweep.
Lost ~8% of my betting portfolio on this, maybe 2-3% of my total port.


## Largest drawdown #1: Reddit IPO
After selling all of my Haley shares I wanted to make some real money on polymarket. I went very, very big into the reddit market cap bracket
shares because I assumed they would not go up significantly on the opening bell.


I was totally wrong.

> I’m praying its not gonna pop 36 percent lol

Well, unfortunately, it did.

On this bet:
1. I should have adjusted my likelihood of a win - downward - higher given the ipo climate and ai-hype was insanely risk-on.
2. I should not have bet as much as I did as a result.

## Insanely lucky ethereum bets

## Largest drawdown #2: Republican VP nominee
This was the largest bet I've ever made in my life, and it made me realize how important risk management was.


## Depression, slowly making my way to -50% ROI 


## Mention markets after largely quitting betting


## Election bets hitherto (GOP), a repeat of primary bets


## For 2025, Trudeau, Russia, Hegseth
