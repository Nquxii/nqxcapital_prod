This reduces the likelihood that a new bettors avoids these markets and sells his bets.\n\nOver time, however, good bettors have enough information to **easily** make money from bids, at least in the long-run.\n\n## Strategy\nThis is because speeches may be targeted based on the appearance. This may seem like a simple fact, and already 'priced-in', but polymarket suffers badly from recency bias.\n\nIf Trump doesn't say something in one rally, odds are that its odds for the next rally will be very low. The opposite is true if Trump says something a lot.\n\nThe key is to make small bets with high extrinsic value.\n\n\n### Examples, personal bets\nThe best example of a good bet I made on a mention market is on Trump's rally in Prarie Du Chen, Wisconsin.\nBy the [press release](https://example.com), (which apparently nobody looks at), it was obvious that the speech would be limited to remarks on the border,\n\nand current events, since Trump likes to ramble about those. \nYou can also see that the stage that Trump was performing at was very small, in fact, it was an elementary school.\n\nHence, I bought a lot of NO shares on Trump saying \"Tax Queen\"\n\nThe price was trading at 65/35 Yes/No, since Trump said it in his last rally (his last appearance was about remarks on the tax code, so it would be a no-brainer to bet on it)\n\n\n\n## Dangers and ad-hoc narratives.\n\nThe most common mistake I make *currently* as a bettor on mention market is bidding on markets with bad odds. Trump can say anything at a rally, you never know what comes on his mind.\nEven if the base rates for a specific word are low, betting against him saying something for a high price is unwise. I made this mistake today, in fact, betting against him saying \"Vance\".\nHe said it, and I lost $1000 since shares were going for 50c.\n\nIt's also important not to create ad-hoc narratives ie a forced thesis. For example, if Trump is speaking at some event in Pennsylvania, more likely than not, his remarks will follow previous rallies.\nThere's no need to bet harder on things like the economy and the border at bad odds - as previously mentioned, there are tons of opportunities to profit in MMs. Don't waste your money and over-bet.\n\nI've personally lost tons of money betting against Trump saying \"trans\", because I placed value in where exactly he was making the rally, and in what setting, instead of considering the nature of the remark,\nwhich is to rile up voters at the *end* of his rallies as part of his teleprompter speech.\n\nThese markets are competitive in nature; if you give out tips for free, markets will become more efficient and you will lose income opportunities.\n\nIn fact, I would argue that if newcomers or irrational bettors didn't exist, the odds would fall out of my favor and I would not be able to make any lucrative bets.\n\n\n### Low liquidity\n\nAfter making ~$8000 from various bets on mention markets, I found that many veterans began to stop betting on them.\nI guess it's because base rate bets kept failing and there was no empirical evidence that their strategy worked.\n\nThe viability of these markets will come into question throughout the next few months - will polymarket stop promoting them given how unfavorable they are to newcomers?",
