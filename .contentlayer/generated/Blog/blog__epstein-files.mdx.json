Kennedy Jr., the September 11 terrorist attacks and the prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe task force, called the “Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets,” will be led by controversial Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna – a staunch ally of President Donald Trump.\n\nIt seeks to declassify records related to areas of “public interest” as part of Trump’s executive order on releasing information about the assassinations of Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nRepresentative James Comer, the chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, announced the task force would “build” on the Trump administration’s goal to declassify records of “national importance.”\n\n“The federal government has been hiding information from Americans for decades,” Luna said in a press conference on Tuesday. “We have spent years seeking information on the assassinations of President Kennedy, Senator Kennedy, Reverend King, and other government secrets without success. It is time to give Americans the answers they deserve.”\n\nHere is a look at the committee and the conspiracies it will investigate:\n\nRepublican Anna Paulina Luna is leading a task force to investigate de-classifying matters of ‘public interest’ such as the assassination of former president John F. Kennedy\nopen image in gallery\nRepublican Anna Paulina Luna is leading a task force to investigate de-classifying matters of ‘public interest’ such as the assassination of former president John F. Kennedy (Getty Images)\nWho is on the task force?\nSo far, Luna has announced six Republicans as part of the task force, though she said she would be expanding it to the “entire governing body” for “certain members” and insisted it would be a “beacon of bipartisanship.”\n\nRepublican Representatives Tim Burchett, Lauren Boebert, Eric Burlison, Eli Crane, Brandon Gill and Nancy Mace have been named as members.\n\nA video displays an unidentified flying object during a hearing of the House Intelligence, Subcommittee on Counterterrorism in 2022\nopen image in gallery\nA video displays an unidentified flying object during a hearing of the House Intelligence, Subcommittee on Counterterrorism in 2022 (Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)\nWhat is the task force doing?\nThe task force seeks to make declassification recommendations to federal agencies by first reviewing documents and listening to closed-door briefings on the various areas of interest.\n\nLuna’s task force has approximately six months to complete the project and has already asked members of the Trump administration for documents – both classified and not – as well as briefings.\n\nThe task force does not have subpoena powers, but Comer said the Oversight Committee, which does, will back the task force to compel testimony if needed. However, Comer said the committee has a good relationship with Trump’s administration and does not expect there to be many issues.\n\nThe first task force hearing is set for March and will cover the assassination of former president John Kennedy, Luna wrote on X.\n\nTrump signs an executive order calling for the declassification of files related to the assassination of JFK\nopen image in gallery\nTrump signs an executive order calling for the declassification of files related to the assassination of JFK (AFP via Getty Images)\nWhat will the task force be looking into?\nIn 11 letters sent to various members of the Trump administration, Luna and Comer requested documents related to the origins of Covid-19, the existence of extra-terrestrial life, unidentified anomalous phenomenons, September 11 terrorist attacks, Operation Neptune Spear, the prosecution of Epstein and assassinations of King, JFK and RFK.\n\nLuna also said the task force would look into unidentified submerged objects.\n\nMany of these topics have ignited conspiracy theories online – in part due to the secrecy around available information and decades of public mistrust in the government.\n\nThe September 11 terrorist attacks and subsequent killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, known as Operation Neptune Spear, have been subject to conspiracies for decades. Despite extensive documents and declassified information being released to the public, proponents of the theories argue some inconsistencies point to a larger cover-up.\n\nCongress has held several hearings on UAPs and extra-terrestrial life, which revealed little concrete evidence to confirm the existence of extra-terrestrials. However, those who believe extra-terrestrial life is real have asserted that the government is covering up proof of their existence.\n\nFederal agencies and Congress have also conducted thorough investigations into the origins of Covid-19, which have become somewhat politicalized. Reports released by Republicans support a lab leak theory, while reports released by Democrats lean more toward a natural origin theory.\n\nThe prosecution of Epstein, which never made it to trial because Epstein died in prison, is one of the most recent topics of public interest that has spun into political theories. Many people who believe Epstein was intertwined with notable politicians have demanded the “list” of people who traveled to his notorious island be published.\n\nFebruary 11, 2025\nThe Honorable Chris Wright\nSecretary\nU.S. Department of Energy\n1000 Independence Ave., S.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20585\nDear Secretary Wright:\nThe Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Task Force on the\nDeclassification of Federal Secrets are conducting oversight of the declassification of certain\nrecords in the public interest.
