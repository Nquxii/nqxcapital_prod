    "raw": "\nAfter a few bad bets, like betting against Trump appearing on the Joe Rogan podcast, and a few risky mention market bets, I'm back to a 7k portfolio.\n\nIt was worse, but I made a few trades to get out of the 6k range I was in. It's been tough.\n\nIn this post, I'll document every trade I make starting from today, Oct 24, 2024.\n\n\n\n---\n## Market\n[What will Trump say during PA rally?](https://polymarket.com/event/what-will-trump-say-during-pennsylvania-rally-oct-26)\n\nThe sub-market in question is whether or not he'll say \"Border\" at least 25 times.\n\n**Bet**\\\n3000 NO @ 25c\\\ncost basis = $750\n\n## Thesis \nIt should be noted that Trump will \"deliver remarks\" at this rally - implying it will be more technical / policy focused.\n\nThe [press release](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/9ff8a5ad-9bf4-44a1-a215-1228cb0a3ccd) has no mention of border.\n\n\nLet's look at the base rates:\n\n![base rate graph during most mentions. Data is slightly inaccurate.](/static/images/will-trump-say-border25-college.png)\n\nWe can see that recently it's been a hit or miss.\n\nInstead of deferring to 50% however, let's look at previous PA rallies, especially \"delivers remarks\".\n\nHe usually says it less than 25 times. But he said it a lot in Erie PA and Latrobe PA.\n\nLooking at the press release for those rallies, however, they explictly mention the border.\nIn Erie,  for example, \n\n> Meanwhile, Border Czar Kamala Harris' wide open southern border has brought tens of millions of unvetted foreigners and literal tons of lethal drugs right into our country. Pennsylvania communities are being hollowed out by a scourge of drugs like fentanyl flowing across the border, as other communities struggle to absorb thousands of migrants being sent to their doorsteps.\n\nIn Latrobe: \n\n> The Harris-Biden administration’s inflationary policies and disastrous handling of our southern border has devastated Pennsylvania.\n\n> Meanwhile, tens of millions of illegal immigrants have flooded our country on Kamala’s watch, worsening already sky-high rent and real estate costs.\n\n> President Trump will secure our borders and protect the American Worker from unfair competition and practices, all to Make America Safe, Wealthy, and Great Again.\n\nAdditionally, Pennsylvania is not a border state. So the issue is less salient.\n\nTrump is also speaking at a rally in Traverse City, Michigan, on the *same day*, so he has to *travel* to another state in a few hours.\nBoth PA and MI are rust belt, economic-heavy states. I imagine this will be the broader focus for both rallies.\n\nSo ultimately, this bet becomes a bet on whether or not Trump will *voluntarily* mention the border over 25 times. I would put these odds at 35/65 YES, giving leeway for Yes holders, because \nrecently rallies have been longer.\n\n**I want to put $600 on this bet, because I like the odds. I feel like the market is plagued by recency bias.**\n\nAlso, \"delivers remarks\" + zero mention of border is a very good environment, however the large stage he's presenting at (and how close the election is!) makes me worried he will ramble...\n\n## Resolution, thoughts, mistakes\nHe did in fact go into the border, but he didn't say it 25 times. Lucky.\n\nHe went into the border after speaking largely on the economy (fracking, taxes)\n\nThe lesson here is not to treat press releases as gospel. Also, consider context. He's at penn state college, he is talking to a bunch of young people.\n\nSo most likely he goes \"socially liberal and fiscally conservative\".\n\nSo he talks about ww3, the border the economy, jobs.\n\n---\n## Market\n[What will Trump say during Las Vegas rally?](https://polymarket.com/event/what-will-trump-say-during-las-vegas-rally/)\n\n## Bet\n- No on Reno\n- No on Border 35+\n- No on Korea\n- No on pocahontas\n- No on Trans\n\n### Thesis \nRespectively,\n- He generally doesn't refer to previous events in his rallies. I can't imagine him saying \"I was in reno the other day\" ect. as he campaigns so often he hardly remembers things.\n- Nevada is not a border state, the base rate is low, and that's not what this rally is about.\n- Very low base rate (42%), and it is no longer a part of his prepared remarks. Hasn't said it since detroit economic club remarks. Not salient.\n- I'm selling out of this bet. Unfortunately taking a 75% loss because I didn't realize the base rate was 100% since his rally in Juneau, Wisconsin.\n- I'm sellin out of this bet. I initially thought the rally would be very short and pay tribute to AAPI communities. However, this doesn't seem likely in hindsight. also an incredibly high base rate. \nonly bet if you **know** trump won't say his usual remarks at the end of his appearance.\n\n### Resolution, thoughts, mistakes\n\n- Everything resolved 'No' aside from \"pocahontas\" and \"trans\" - those two terms were a part of Trump's prepared remarks i.e. what appeared on the teleprompter.\n---\n## Market\nVarious bets - see photo\n\n## Bet\n![Before](/static/images/mass-bets.png)\n\n### Thesis \nTrump won't use usual campaign rhetoric.\n\n### Resolution, thoughts, mistakes\nBad bets. Overall down $300 because of these bets - Rogan's podcast with Trump was so long he said pretty much everything. It's worth mentioning, however, that \"aliens\" was a good bet.\nIt's just that Trump said it in reference to actual extraterrestrial life.\n\n---\n## Market\n[What will Trump say during New York rally?](https://polymarket.com/event/what-will-trump-say-during-new-york-rally-oct-27?tid=1729982374637)\n\n## Bets, thesis\n- NO on tax 30+ | 1000 @ 45c\n    - base rate is low (see image)\n    - the rally is most likely on unity\n    - new york doesn't have a big drilling / manufacturing industry where tax is salient\n    - bear case is if he goes deep into the economy and begins rambling (repeating tax)\n- NO on \"too big to rig\" 2+ | 33c\n    - base rate is very low now, he stopped saying it more than once at his rallies.\n    - I don't think he'll go for this rhetoric since the rally is so important\n\n### Resolution, thoughts, mistakes\nUltimately got lucky and won all bets, though I sold a few tax 30+ shares.\n\nI'm kinda sad that I missed out on an extra $400 by selling it, but ultimately you gotta protect your capital.\n\nHe didn't go into tax - New York doesn't really have an industry where it's that important to mention tax.\n\nNo manufacturing industry ect. in NY I guess.\n\nThe base rate is also low, so we're good.\n\n---\nI'm back to a ~$9k portfolio. Won't blow up this time. I protect my capital first before making decisions.",
