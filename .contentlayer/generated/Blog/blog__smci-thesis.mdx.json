    "raw": "# Introduction\n\nEvidently the stock is not in a good position according to the market. It's down ~70% from its blow-off top in March 2024.\n\nThis is because of \n\n1. general fall in semiconductor stocks\n2. Hindenburg Research's short report alleging accounting fraud among other illegal behaviors\n3. E&Y Resigning as SMCI's auditor\n\n> It is a rare sight these days to find positive analyst commentary on Super Micro Computer (SMCI), \n> a major retailer of servers and AI racks, given the company's long list of troubles, including allegations of accounting malpractice, \n> the unceremonious exit of a well-regarded audit firm, and ongoing filing delays for the company's financial statements. \n\nSource: https://wccftech.com/a-wall-street-analyst-on-super-micro-computer-having-stood-on-the-sidelines-of-the-nascent-gb200-cycle-so-far-we-believe-smci-could-re-enter-the-blackwell-fray-with-the-launch-of-gb300/\n\n## principles\nP1: SMCI is a fundamentally strong company with a solid moat in the AI industry. It also provides liquid cooling ai solutions, which will be percieved as beneficial to its stock price.\nP2: If earnings growth stays the same and other doubts re. the stock clear up, SMCI will return to its previous valuation / forward pe ratio\nP3: Hindenburg Research's short report is biased and overstates the severity of the issue\nP4: Delisting from the nasdaq is unlikely since SMCI can easily publish its 10-K with its new auditor (this is just a compliance issue)\n\n\n## P2 \n\n## P4\n- Nasdaq granted SMCI an extension until February 25, 2025, to file its Annual Report (10-K) for FY2024 and Quarterly Report (10-Q) for Q1 2025\n\nSo, two reports have been delayed due to E&Y's auditing.\n\nIs there anything significant that E&Y saw in the lead up to hindenburg's report that made them resign? No, it was only *after* their report that E&Y resigned.\n\nPerspective\n> Completely wrong. The EY claims of concerns brought to management in late July was not public knowledge and therefore the short report in August 2024 was the earliest of accusations of possible financial statement fraud. The company also has had a past related to shady financial statements.\n> I personally believe that EY only acted this way due to that short report, otherwise they would have walked away sooner. Its hard to believe that they did interim testing and found issues and didn't walk away then. Very convenient to only walk away when there is such a damaging short report. They probably would have signed off the audit report had that report not been released.\n> Also, this WAS a small cap until fairly recently, their internal controls were 100% going to be garbage considering the meteoric rise they had.\n\n\n## P3\n\nLet's look at previous internal failures in Supermicro\n- Aug 2020 incidents: https://www.wsj.com/articles/supermicro-fined-17-5-million-over-accounting-violations-11598481716\n\n> Supermicro has since improved its internal controls and reorganized its management team, the SEC said. The company was relisted on the Nasdaq Global Market in January.\n\nThey got briefly delisted after *two years* of the stock being paused.\n\nThe only consequence was a $17.5m fee. \n\n> note, In February 2021, Bloomberg Business reported that despite Supermicro having been compromised since 2011, \nU.S. intelligence kept it a secret to gather intelligence about China and warned only a small number of potential targets\n\n## Summary of the situation\n\n> In 2024, short-seller Hindenburg Research alleged that Supermicro continued to engage in accounting violations, adding that the company rehired executives who were involved in the accounting scandal. The report also alleged that the company was evading U.S. export restrictions by shipping advanced technology products to Russia. Hindenburg also pointed out alleged \"circular\" financial relationship with Supermicro's suppliers, Ablecom and Compuware, which are controlled and partially owned by the brothers of Supermicro's CEO.[29] The next day, Supermicro said it would delay the filing of its annual report, causing its stock to collapse over 25%.[30] The U.S. Department of Justice opened a preliminary probe into the company a month after the report, according to The Wall Street Journal.[31] In October 2024, Supermicro's auditors, Ernst & Young resigned after raising significant concerns over the company's internal controls, board independence and accounting practices, which led the company to lose a third of its market value.[32] \n\nI'm not convinced that Hindenburg has a material short narrative here. Yes, the company is slightly \"fishy\", Liang has sus relationships with other companies,\n\nbut the bottom line is that it's unlikely that we see a delisting or more delays. This isn't 2020. SMCI is a $20b company and a huge ai player, I don't think they will suffer a huge fallout \n\nand continue to fail to report their earnings.\n\n\n# Story - for chatgpt: \n\n# Based on the following information, estimate the probability that Supermicro will fail to meet the late February deadline for their 10-K report?\n\n# How did supermicro get in this situation\n\n1. Supermicro is accused of fraudulent accounting, among other deceptive practices by Hindenburg\n\n    Super Micro Computer Inc. is a $35 billion server maker based in Silicon Valley, California that has ridden the wave of AI enthusiasm.\n    Our 3-month investigation, which included interviews with former senior employees and industry experts as well as a review of litigation records, international corporate and customs records, found glaring accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues.\n    In 2018, Super Micro was temporarily delisted from Nasdaq for failing to file financial statements. By August 2020, the company was charged by the SEC for “widespread accounting violations,” mainly related to $200+ million in improperly recognized revenue and understated expenses, resulting in artificially elevated sales, earnings and profit margins.\n    Less than 3 months after paying a $17.5 million SEC settlement, Super Micro began re-hiring top executives that were directly involved in the accounting scandal, per litigation records and interviews with former employees.\n    A former salesperson told us: “Almost all of them are back. Almost all of the people that were let go that were the cause of this malfeasance.”\n    According to a lawsuit filed in April 2024, Super Micro waited only 3 months after the SEC settlement before restarting “improper revenue recognition,” “recognizing incomplete sales,” and “circumvention of internal accounting controls”.\n    Even after the SEC settlement, pressure to meet quotas pushed salespeople to stuff the channel with distributors using “partial shipments” or by shipping defective products around quarter-end, per our interviews with former employees and customers.\n    One former salesperson described pushing products to distributors based on made-up demand forecasts, completing a partial shipment, then later coming up with an excuse for why the rest didn’t happen. “And now you have a problem. Accounting problem maybe.”\n    Former employees told us Super Micro’s business culture has not improved. Former senior sales director: “I don’t think the behavior of the company in many ways has changed in the 5 years since I started, and I started shortly after that delisting problem.”\n    Three senior employees who left in early 2018 amidst the accounting scandal were rehired, individually serving as (1) a member of the board of directors (2) a consultant serving close to the CEO (3) and a VP of business development.\n    Former CFO Howard Hideshima left the company in January 2018 and was later individually charged by the SEC with accounting violations. In May 2023, he was hired by a key related party owned by Super Micro CEO’s brother.\n    A new CFO, praised by co-workers for his integrity, was hired in January 2018 to help the company recover from the scandal. He helped Super Micro re-list but resigned in January 2021. A former sales director suggested that he was edged out by the company.\n    Beyond fresh questions around its revenue accounting, we found that Super Micro’s relationships with both disclosed and undisclosed related parties serve as fertile ground for dubious accounting.\n    For example, disclosed related party suppliers Ablecom and Compuware, controlled by Super Micro CEO Charles Liang’s brothers, have been paid $983 million in the last 3 years. Ablecom is also partly owned by Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and his wife.\n    The relationships seem oddly circular. Super Micro provides components to the entities which assemble them and sell them back to Super Micro. They also rent warehousing and factory space to Super Micro even though it has its own sprawling factory.\n    The related parties seem to do little other business: ~99.8% of Ablecom’s exports to the U.S. since 2020 were to Super Micro, and ~99.7% of Compuware’s U.S. exports were to Super Micro, per trade records.\n    In addition to the concerns around the disclosed related parties, we found evidence of undisclosed related parties. The youngest brother of Super Micro’s CEO owns two Taiwan-based entities that make server components. Media reports and former employees indicate the entities are Super Micro suppliers.\n    Both entities operate out of the Super Micro Science and Technology Park in Taiwan, but Super Micro has not disclosed related party transactions with them.\n    Another brother of Super Micro’s CEO operates a disclosed related party but is also the director and shareholder of undisclosed Hong Kong and Taiwanese entities, which appear to resell Super Micro products and provide “professional OEM services.” It operates out of the same building as related party Compuware.\n    Collectively, disclosed and undisclosed related parties pose accounting risks relating to revenue recognition and reported margins. A former executive told us: “Basically it’s a governance issue and just kind of shows you that Charles doesn’t give a shit what you think…you’re right to worry, though, that you just never know what’s lurking.”\n    In addition to the CEO’s brothers, the company has an odd relationship with a key customer. In February 2024, Super Micro made an undisclosed investment in tech startup Lambda Labs as part of its $320 million funding round, per Bloomberg and per a confirmation we received from Lambda’s COO.\n    In August 2024, Super Micro signed an “unusual” $600 million contract to lease space at a California data center and sub-lease it to Lambda. The CFO glossed over questions about the reason for this arrangement.\n    In October 2023, two related parties run by CEO Liang’s brothers, one of them partially owned by Super Micro’s CEO, reportedly invested in small Taiwanese tech company Leadtek. Leadtek’s website advertises products almost identical to Super Micro’s, yet Super Micro discloses no relationship with Leadtek in what appears to be a clear undisclosed related party.\n    Super Micro has claimed its liquid cooling technology will “revolutionize the industry” and is its “competitive edge.” But at a recent industry conference, Super Micro featured related party Ablecom’s liquid cooling solutions, per an Ablecom engineer.\n    Ablecom has several patents for its liquid cooling technology. Despite this, Super Micro has never disclosed any related party involvement in its liquid cooling technology.\n    Besides questions around related parties and proprietary product offerings, in 2006, Super Micro pleaded guilty to a felony count of exporting banned components to Iran. The CEO said the company was in its infancy and had learned from its mistakes.\n    When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. government imposed stringent restrictions and bans on exports to Russia of high-performance computers and components.\n    Super Micro disclosed that some of its products were subject to export bans and said it was halting all sales and had “not recorded revenue” from Russia since the day before the war started.\n    Exports of Super Micro’s high-tech components to Russia have spiked ~3x since the invasion of Ukraine, apparently violating U.S. export bans, according to our review of more than 45,000 import/export transactions.\n    At least 46 companies that handled Super Micro products to Russia since the invasion are now under OFAC sanctions or on U.S. government watchlists.\n    Almost two-thirds of Super Micro’s exports to Russia since the invasion correspond to “high priority” components that the Russian military may be diverting to the battlefield, per U.S. government warnings.\n    One of the biggest importers of Super Micro products in Russia is a supplier to one of Russia’s largest “supercomputers” at a once-secret, now-sanctioned research center. That importer, Niagara Computers, has received at least $46.3 million worth of Super Micro products since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, per trade data.\n    The sales were initially made through a distributor in California, but were later made through 3 newly-formed Turkish shell companies, including one that was eventually sanctioned for smuggling restricted items to Russia.\n    Almost $30 million worth of Super Micro components have also been shipped to Russia’s largest importer of dual-use civilian-military chips via a newly created Hong Kong shell entity. That Russian importer is now under OFAC sanctions.\n    Since 2016, Super Micro has had a joint venture with a Chinese state-run company called Fiberhome, which is involved in a campaign of “human rights violations and abuses,” high-tech surveillance, and repression of ethnic communities in western China, per the U.S. government.\n    Super Micro has sold ~$196 million of sophisticated computer components to the joint venture since Fiberhome was watchlisted by the U.S. government in 2020. Super Micro justifies the sales by saying the JV entity itself wasn’t watchlisted, even though its partner was.\n    Besides accounting issues and sanctions evasion, competition and quality concerns have resulted in major companies dropping Super Micro entirely or reducing their share.\n    Nvidia is a key partner and chip supplier to Super Micro. In May 2024, CEO Jensen Huang publicly endorsed Super Micro’s competition: “Nobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell.”\n    CoreWeave was Super Micro’s largest customer over the last year, per Bloomberg Intelligence. But in December 2023, Dell announced a deal with CoreWeave for “thousands” of GPU servers, potentially worth over $1 billion.\n    Tesla had been sourcing its servers exclusively from Super Micro, per Barclays Research in September 2023. But recent reports in May 2024 and posts by Elon Musk show Dell has now won major deals from Tesla, and Musk’s xAI, eroding Super Micro’s exclusivity.\n    Super Micro has conceded that it is “under-indexed” with the world’s largest technology companies, called “hyperscalers.” Amazon AWS was a customer but cut ties after delivery issues, per a former employee.\n    Digital Ocean, a U.S. cloud service provider, switched from Super Micro to Dell after service issues, according to a Digital Ocean employee, describing the relationship as “a train wreck of sorts” fraught with reliability issues.\n    Genesis Cloud is touted as a “success story” on Super Micro’s website. But current and former employees told us otherwise: “Catastrophic. It is, on the technical side, one of my worst experiences I’ve had…in the industry.”\n    GMI Cloud, a start-up GPU cloud provider in Asia and the U.S., told us they experienced a malfunction rate of 17.5% on its orders of 256 Super Micro servers. GMI is now moving away from Super Micro to HPE less than a year after its first order, per an employee.\n    NexGen Cloud, an Nvidia partner, disclosed in October 2023 that it was investing $1 billion to build an AI super-cloud in Europe with over 20,000 Nvidia GPUs. But a NexGen employee told us that sometimes up to half of the orders received from Super Micro had firmware issues.\n    Multiple former employees and channel partners confirmed that after-sales service is undermining Super Micro’s ability to retain customers. One former salesperson said: “It’s their Achilles heel. It’s just horrible.”\n    All told, we believe Super Micro is a serial recidivist. It benefitted as an early mover but still faces significant accounting, governance and compliance issues and offers an inferior product and service now being eroded away by more credible competition.\n\n2. The only evidence of this is via a lawsuit by Bob K Huong detailed:\n    312345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728United States District CourtNorthern District of CaliforniaArbitration AgreementAs a condition of accepting and/or continuing employment with the Company, I agree to final and binding arbitration of Disputes between me and the Company, in accordance with the Arbitration of Disputes policy, the terms of which areincorporated by reference herein. I understand and agree that the Arbitration of Disputes policy (the terms of which control in the event of a conflict) requires arbitration of all Disputes which involvethe violation of my rights or the Company’s rights arising from my employment or the termination of myemployment, including but not limited to violations of rights arising from employment discrimination and/orwrongfultermination of employment, breach of contract or other wrongful conduct, or breach of the Company’spolicies, rights or contracts respecting confidential information and/or trade secrets. I understand andagree thatmy agreement to arbitrate Disputes means that I have voluntarily surrendered my rights to civil litigation and atrial by jury and any associated rights of appeal.Chan Decl. Ex. 2(Employee Acknowledgement Form).Plaintiff’s signature appears immediately below this language.  See id.Arbitration of Disputes PolicyThe Arbitration of Disputes policy(“Policy”)referred toby and incorporated into the Employee Acknowledgement Formis contained in the SMCI employee handbook.  SeeChan Decl. ¶ 6.  ThePolicy, comprising 5 pages of the handbook, providesin relevant partthat“[a]ll employees are required to agree to arbitrate Disputes (as described below) as a condition of employment” with SMCI.  Chan Decl. Ex. 3(Policy).  “Covered Disputes” are defined to include “any complaint that there has been a violation” of the employee’s rights by SMCI or its officers, employees, or agents.  Id.The Policy describes the procedure for requesting arbitration, and states that “[a]ll questions concerning arbitrability, including but not limited to whether a party has anobligation to arbitrate a Dispute . . . shall be decided by a court not anarbitrator.”  Id.The employee “will not be responsible for any part of the arbitrator’s fees and costs.”  Id.The last paragraph of the policy, written in all capital letters and bolded, states:YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, BY ACCEPTING EMPLOYMENT AND/ORCONTINUING YOUR EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY, YOU AGREE TOEXCLUSIVE, FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION OF ANY COVERED DISPUTESBETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS ANDCONDITIONS OF THIS POLICY, AND YOU VOLUNTARILY AGREE TOSURRENDER YOUR RIGHTS TO CIVIL LITIGATION AND A TRIAL BY JURY ANDANY ASSOCIATED RIGHTS OF APPEAL.\n    412345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728United States District CourtNorthern District of CaliforniaId.Present Lawsuitand Present MotionLuong filed the present lawsuit against SMCI and Liang on April 24, 2024, andfiled the operative FAC on May 6, 2024, asserting claims for retaliation underSOX, California Labor Code §1102.5, and FEHA.  SeeCompl., ECF 1; FAC, ECF 6.  Defendants requested that Luong agree to arbitrate his state law claimspursuant to the parties’ written arbitration agreement, but Luong refused.  SeeJordan Decl. ¶¶2-3.  Defendants thereafter filed the present motion to compel arbitration of the state claim claims (Claims 2 and 3) and to stay this action, including the non-arbitrable SOX claim (Claim 1), pending completion of arbitration.II.LEGAL STANDARDThe Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) embodies a “national policy favoring arbitration and a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary.” AT&T Mobility, LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 345-46 (2011) (internal quotationmarks and citations omitted).“The FAA, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., requires federal district courts to stay judicial proceedings and compel arbitration of claims covered by a written and enforceable arbitration agreement.” Nguyen v. Barnes & Noble Inc., 763 F.3d 1171, 1175 (9th Cir. 2014).“Generally, in deciding whether to compel arbitration, a court must determine two ‘gateway’issues: (1) whether there is an agreement to arbitrate between the parties; and (2) whether the agreement covers the dispute.”  Brennan v. Opus Bank, 796 F.3d 1125, 1130 (9th Cir. 2015).  The first of these issues is non-delegable and must be decided by the district court. See Ahlstrom v. DHI Mortg. Co., Ltd., L.P., 21 F.4th 631, 635 (9th Cir. 2021) (“[P]arties cannot delegate issues of formation to the arbitrator.”).The second issue is presumptively reserved for the court, but the parties may agree to delegate it to the arbitrator.See id.at 634; see alsoPortland Gen. Elec. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 862 F.3d 981, 985 (9th Cir. 2017)(“[W]hether an arbitration clause in a concededly binding contract applies to a given controversy” is “presumptively reserved for the court” unless the parties clearly and unmistakably delegate that issue to the arbitrator).\n    512345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728United States District CourtNorthern District of CaliforniaIII.DISCUSSIONAs noted above, Luong asserts a single federal claim for retaliation under SOX (Claim 1) and two state law claims for retaliation under California Labor Code §1102.5 and FEHA (Claims 2 and3).The SOX claim is asserted against both SMCI and Liang.  However, the parties agree that the SOX claim cannot be compelled to arbitration.  See18 U.S.C. § 1514A(e)(2) (“No predispute arbitration provision shall be valid or enforceable, if the agreement requires arbitration of a dispute arising under this section.”).The state law claims are asserted against only SMCI.  Defendants move to compel arbitration of the state law claims, arguing that Luong and SMCI entered into an arbitration agreement that is governed by the FAA, the arbitration agreement is enforceable, and the state law claims fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement.  Defendants move to stay this litigation, including the SOX claim, pending arbitration of the state law claims.Luong does not dispute that the asserted arbitration agreement is governed by the FAA, as “[e]mployment contracts, except for those covering workers engaged in transportation, are covered by the FAA.”  See E.E.O.C. v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U.S. 279, 289 (2002).  Nor does Luong dispute that hisstate law claims fall within the scope of the asserted arbitration agreement.However, he contends that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable on the grounds that it is unconscionable and that it violates SOX.He further contends that even if the Court grants Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration of the state law claims, the Court should deny Defendants’ motion to stay with respect to the SOX claim and instead allow the SOX claim to proceed in this Court.  A.Luong and SMCIEntered into an Arbitration AgreementIn determining whether an arbitration agreement exists, a district court applies “ordinary state-law principles that govern the formation of contracts.’”Reichert v. Rapid Invs., Inc., 56 F.4th 1220, 1227(9th Cir. 2022)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).Under California law, an arbitration agreement generally must be memorialized in writing.  See Pinnacle Museum Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Mkt. Dev. (US), LLC, 55 Cal. 4th 223, 236 (2012).  “A party’s acceptance of an agreement to arbitrate may be express, as where a party signs the agreement,” or the party’s \n    612345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728United States District CourtNorthern District of Californiaacceptance may be implied in fact. Id.“An arbitration clause within a contract may be binding on a party even if the party never actually read the clause.”  Id.“The party seeking arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement, and the party opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving any defense, such as unconscionability.”  Id.SMCI submitsthe following documents:a copy of the offer letter signed by Luong, acknowledging that his offer of employment was contingent on his signing all required employment documents, including documents containingan arbitration agreement, seeChan Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. 1 (Offer Letter); a copy of theEmployee Acknowledgement Form signed by Luong, expressly agreeing to final and binding arbitration of disputes with SMCI as a condition of his employment, seeChan Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. 2 (Employee Acknowledgement Form); and a copy of the Arbitration of Disputes policy contained in the employee handbook and incorporated into the Employee Acknowledgement Form, Chan Decl. Ex. 3 (Policy).  This evidence satisfies Defendants’ burden to prove the existence of an arbitration agreement between Luong and SMCI.  Luong does not dispute signing the offer letter or Employee Acknowledgement Form.  He submits a declaration statement that he “was not provided with the employee handbook containing the Arbitration of Disputes Policy referenced in the purported arbitration agreement and was not aware of the terms contained therein prior to signing the purported arbitration agreement.”  Luong Decl. ¶4, ECF 23-1.  This statement is insufficient to undermine Defendants’ showing that the parties entered into an arbitration agreement, as the Employee Acknowledgement Form signed by Luong states expressly that Luong did receive the Arbitration of Disputes policy and agreed to be bound by it.  See Pinnacle, 55 Cal. 4th at 236(“An arbitration clause within a contract may be binding on a party even if the party never actually read the clause.”); see also Sanchez v. Valencia Holding Co., LLC, 61 Cal. 4th 899, 915 (2015) (rejecting argument that plaintiff did not read arbitration clause, observing that “it is generally unreasonable . . . to neglect to read a written contract before signing it”).B.The Arbitration Agreement is EnforceableIf the party seeking arbitration meets its burden to prove the existence of an arbitration agreement, the party opposing arbitration bears the burden to prove any defense.See Pinnacle, 55 \n    712345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728United States District CourtNorthern District of CaliforniaCal. 4th at 236.  Luong argues that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because it is unconscionable and because it violates SOX.  Neither argument is meritorious.1.Unconscionability“[G]enerally applicable contract defenses, such as . . . unconscionability, may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening the FAA or California law.”  OTO, L.L.C. v. Kho, 8 Cal. 5th 111, 125 (2019) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted, alterations in original).  “Both procedural and substantive unconscionability must be shown for the defense to be established[.]”  Id.“The procedural element addresses the circumstances of contract negotiation and formation, focusing onoppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power.”  Id.(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  “Substantive unconscionability pertains to the fairness of an agreement’s actual terms and to assessments of whether they are overly harsh or one-sided.”Id.(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  “The burden of proving unconscionability rests upon the party asserting it.”  Id.at 126.  Luong asserts that the procedural unconscionability requirement is met because he was required to sign the Employee Acknowledgement Form containing the arbitration agreementas a condition of employment, and because the Arbitration of Disputes policy was “buried” in the employee handbook and “merely incorporated by reference” into the Employee Acknowledgement Form. Taking those arguments in reverse order, the Court finds Luong’s characterization of the arbitration policy as “buried” in the employee handbook to be inaccurate.  The policy is 5 pages in length, contains subheadings that make its various provisions easyto access, and concludes with a bolded paragraph written in all capital letters that unequivocally provides for binding arbitration.  The 1-page Employee Acknowledgement Form calls out the key aspects of the arbitration agreement, specifically that it is a condition of employment and encompasses all disputes arising out of employment or termination of employment.  Given Luong’s signature on the 1-page Employee Acknowledgement Form directly above the paragraph addressing arbitration, his assertion that he did not have notice of thatterm of employment is wholly unpersuasive.Moreover, that fact that the arbitration agreementwas a condition of employment does not render it procedurally unconscionable.  “Arbitration contracts imposed as a condition of \n    812345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728United States District CourtNorthern District of Californiaemployment are typically adhesive.”  OTO, 8 Cal. 5th at 126.  “The pertinent question, then, is whether circumstances of the contract’s formation created such oppression or surprise that closer scrutiny of its overall fairness is required.”  Id.“The circumstances relevant to establishing oppression include, but are not limited to (1) the amount of time the party is given to consider the proposed contract; (2) the amount and type of pressure exerted on the party to sign the proposed contract; (3) the length of the proposed contract and the length and complexity of the challenged provision; (4) the education and experience of the party; and (5) whether the party’s review of the proposed contract was aided by an attorney.”Id.at 126-27.  Luong had more than a week between the date the offer of employment was extended, December 19, 2012, and the date he accepted, December 28, 2012.  There is no evidence that any pressure was exerted on him to sign the offer letter and Employee Acknowledgement Form.  The offerletter is 2 pages in length and the Employee Acknowledgement Form containing the arbitration agreement is 1 page in length.  Luong is an educated, sophisticated individual who accepted a position with a base salary of $170,000.  It is unclear whether Luong engaged an attorney to help him review the proposed contract, but he certainly had the opportunity to do so.  Based on this record, the Court finds that Luong has failed to carry his burden of proving procedural unconscionability.Nor has Luong proved substantive unconscionability.“In evaluating substantive unconscionability, courts often look to whether the arbitration agreement meets certain minimum levels of fairness.”  Murrey v. Superior Ct., 87 Cal. App. 5th 1223, 1247-48 (2023).  “[A]t a minimum, a mandatory employment arbitration agreement must (1) provide for neutral arbitrators, (2) provide for more than minimal discovery, (3) require a written award that permits limited judicial review, (4) provide for all of the types of relief that would otherwise be available in court, and (5) require the employer to pay the arbitrator’s fees and all costs unique to arbitration.”  Id.(citation omitted).  Luong argues that the arbitration agreement at issue heredoes not provide for adequate discoveryand may require him to pay costs unique to arbitration, such asDefendants’ costs incurred in responding to his discovery requestsand administrative and facility fees.The California Supreme Court has rejected the notion that anarbitration agreementis unconscionable merely because it grants the arbitrator discretion over what discovery may be taken.  See \n    912345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728United States District CourtNorthern District of CaliforniaArmendariz v. Found. Health Psychcare Servs., Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 83, 105 & n.10 (2000).  With respect to the costs of arbitration, the Arbitration of Disputes policy states that the employee “will not be responsible for any part of the arbitrator’s fees and costs.”  Chan Decl. Ex. 3 (Policy).  The policy does require that each side pay its own discovery costs, as is customary in litigation.  See id.The Court does not read the policy to require Luong to pay Defendants’ costs in responding to discovery requests, or any costs that are unique to arbitration, and Luong has not pointed to any provision of the policy clearly imposing such costs on him.The reliance Luong places on Ronderos v. USF Reddaway, Inc., 114 F.4th 1080 (9th Cir. 2024), and similar cases is misplaced, as those cases involved unsophisticated individuals in factual circumstances dissimilar to this case.  See, e.g., Ronderos, 114 F.4th 1080 (applicant for position of line haul manager pushed to sign agreement immediately and on site); OTO, 8 Cal. 5th 111 (agreement presented to low level worker at his workspace with expectation that he sign it immediately).2.Asserted Violation of SOXLuong contends that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because it encompasses all claims arising out of his employment, including his SOX claim, and thus runs afoul of SOX’s prohibition against arbitration agreements.  The relevant provision of SOX reads as follows: “No predispute arbitration agreement shall be valid or enforceable, if the agreement requires arbitration of a dispute arising under this section.”  18 U.S.C.A. § 1514A(e)(2).According to Luong, that provision invalidates the arbitration agreementat issue hereentirely, with respect to bothhisSOX claim and his non-SOX claims.Luong relies on out-of-circuit decisions from the District of Puerto Ricoand the Western District of Arkansas to support his position.  See Stewart v. Doral Fin. Corp., 997 F. Supp. 2d 129 (D.P.R. 2014); Laubenstein v. Conair Corp., No. 5:14-CV-05227, 2014 WL 6609164(W.D. Ark. Nov. 19, 2014).  Those decisions applied §1514A(e)(2) to invalidate arbitration agreements as to both SOX claims and non-SOX claims where the claims arose from the same facts, reasoning that under those circumstances allowing arbitration of the non-SOX claims would frustrate the purpose of §1514A(e)(2).\n    1012345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728United States District CourtNorthern District of CaliforniaDefendants arguethat Luong’s reading of the SOX prohibition against arbitration agreements is too broad, relying primarily on a California district court decision thatrejected the approach of Stewartand Laubenstein.  See Endresen v. Banc of California, Inc., No. SACV 18-00899-CJC(DFMx), 2018 WL 11399501, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 20, 2018).  The Endresencourt emphasized that the prohibition on arbitration set forth in §1514A(e)(2)is expressly limited to claims arising under SOX, and that “[d]enying arbitration on some claims because there are also non-arbitrable claims ignores the FAA’s ‘emphatic federal policy’in favor of arbitration.”  Id.The Endresencourt acknowledged that the FAAmay be overridden by a clear congressional command,but concluded that SOX does not contain a clear congressional mandate that would extend §1514A(e)(2)beyond the scope of claims brought under SOX.  See id.This Court agrees with the reasoning of Endresen, specifically the conclusion that it would be improper to refuse to enforce a valid arbitration agreement as required under the FAA, absent a clear congressional mandate.  In this Court’s view, a judicial determination that the purpose of SOX’s anti-arbitration provision might be frustrated by compelling arbitration of non-SOX claims arising from the same facts is an insufficient basis to override the FAA.  Moreover, this Court agrees with the Endresencourt’s observation that “it is not clear why arbitration of non-SOX claims would frustrate any purpose of section 1514A, since Plaintiff’s SOX claim still remains before the court.”  Endresen, 2018 WL 11399501, at *3C.The State Law Claims Fall Within the Scope of the Arbitration AgreementThere is no dispute that Luong’s state law claims for retaliation, which clearly arise out of his employment and termination, fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement, and the Court finds that the state law claims do fall within the scope of theagreement.  Accordingly, the Court will grant Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration of Luong’s state law claims.D.A Stay of this Action, Including theSOX Claim, is WarrantedDefendants move to stay this action, including the SOX claim, pending arbitration of the state law claims.Luong opposes a stay of litigation of his SOX claim, asking the Court to allow his SOX claim to proceed in this forum while his state law claims proceed in arbitration.Where a complaint asserts both arbitrable and non-arbitrable claims, the defendants are not \n    1112345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728United States District CourtNorthern District of Californiaentitled to a stay of the non-arbitrable claims as of right, but the district court may in its discretion stay the non-arbitrable claims “under the powers to control its own docket and to provide for the prompt and efficient determination of the cases pending before it.”  Leyva v. Certified Grocers of California, Ltd., 593 F.2d 857, 863 (9th Cir. 1979).  “A stay should not be granted unless it appears likely the other proceedings will be concluded within a reasonable time in relation to the urgency of the claims presented to the court.”  Id.at 864.  In Leyva, the Ninth Circuit found that “[i]t would waste judicial resources and be burdensome upon the parties if the district court in a case such as this were mandated to permit discovery, and upon completion of pretrial proceedings, to take evidence and determine the merits of the case at the same time as the arbitrator is going through a substantially parallel process.”  Id.Other courts in this district have found it appropriate to stay a SOX claim pending arbitration of non-SOX claims arising from the same facts.  See, e.g., Anderson v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 18-CV-06712-PJH, 2018 WL 6728015, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 21, 2018).  The Andersoncourt found it “appropriate to stay plaintiff’s SOX claim and the entire action because plaintiff’s claims all arise from the same conduct and because allowing the arbitration to resolve will simplify issues of law or questions of fact in future proceedings.”  Id.As in Anderson, Luong’snon-arbitrable SOX claim and arbitrable state law claims arise from the same conduct, and staying litigation of the SOX claim pending arbitration of the state law claims may simplify questions of fact and/or issues of law in future proceedings. Luongargues that such simplification would prejudice his ability to litigate his SOX claim, because discovery in the arbitration will be far more limited than discovery available in district court.  He asserts that there is a substantial risk that his SOX claim will be subject to issue preclusion arising from an adverse arbitration decision on the non-SOX claims.  Luong urgesthe Court to deny the requested stay of the SOX claim, citing an out-of-circuitdecision in which the court found it appropriate toallow the SOX claim to be litigated in parallel with arbitration of the non-SOX claims.  See Vuoncino v. Forterra, Inc., No. 3:21-CV-01046-K, 2022 WL 868274, at *8 (N.D. Tex. Feb. 28, 2022), report and recommendation adopted, No. 3:21-CV-01046-K, 2022 WL 865893 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 22, 2022). \n    1212345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728United States District CourtNorthern District of CaliforniaWhile Luong’s prejudice argumenthas some facial appeal, he has not demonstrated that he is likely to be prejudiced by any limitations in the arbitration proceeding.  His prejudice argument is premised on the assumption that he will not prevail in arbitration,and thus will be denied a fair opportunity to litigate his SOX claim because he will be bound by an adverse arbitration decision based on limited discovery.  Luong’s apparent assumption that he will lose at arbitration is not founded on any record evidence.  Moreover, when the Court inquired at the hearing whether the arbitrator’s decision onthenon-SOX claims would be binding on this Court during subsequent litigation of the SOX claim, Luong’s counsel was unable to direct the Court to any controlling authority.  Accordingly, the Court finds Luong’s argument of prejudice to be purely speculative.  The Court in the exercise of its discretion finds that a stay of this litigation, including the SOX claim, is warranted for reasons of economy and efficiency.  Luong’s SOX claim arises from the same facts as his non-SOX claims,and under those circumstances allowing this case to proceed in parallel to the arbitration likely would result in a waste of judicial resources and imposition of an undue burden on Defendants.  Important to this decision is the representation of Defendants’ counsel at the hearing that the parties are poised to commence arbitration as soon as the Court issues its ruling.  The Court will require the parties to begin arbitration within 60 days after this order.IV.ORDER(1) Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration and stay action is GRANTED.

Justice Department Probes Server Maker Super Micro Computer\n    Super Micro Computer, the server maker that saw its business take off with the artificial-intelligence boom, is being probed by the Justice Department following a critical report by an activist short-selling firm, according to people familiar with the matter.\n    The probe is at an early stage, the people said. A prosecutor at the U.S. attorney’s office in San Francisco recently has contacted people potentially holding relevant information. \n    The prosecutor asked for information that appeared to be connected to a former employee who accused the company of accounting violations. The former employee filed a whistleblower lawsuit in April against Super Micro and its chief executive.\n    A Super Micro spokesman declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office.\n    Short seller Hindenburg Research published its report about Super Micro on Aug. 27, and said it had placed bets against the company’s stock. The report focused in part on allegations made by the former employee, Bob Luong, as well as transactions between Super Micro and companies run by family members of its chief executive, Charles Liang.\n    Shares of Super Micro surged with the bull market in AI-themed stocks. The company, commonly known as Supermicro, makes specialized servers that use the chips Nvidia designs for generative AI. \n    The stock rose 14-fold from the start of 2023 through March and has since tumbled 59%. At its peak, the company was worth $66 billion.  \n    Super Micro in 2020 paid $17.5 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission claims of widespread accounting violations, without admitting or denying the accusations. The SEC also reached a settlement with a former Super Micro chief financial officer, and it required Liang to reimburse the company $2.1 million in stock-sale profits even though it didn’t accuse Liang of misconduct.\n    In his lawsuit, Luong said Super Micro fired several employees associated with the past accounting violations, only to hire them back later. Hindenburg highlighted the same point in its report. Hindenburg also said it had found instances of Super Micro products being shipped to companies in Russia after the war in Ukraine began, despite U.S. sanctions.\n    On Aug. 28, the day after the Hindenburg report, Super Micro said it would be late filing its fiscal 2024 annual report with the SEC. The company soon afterward said its board of directors had formed a committee “to review certain of the company’s internal controls and other matters.” The company still hasn’t filed its annual report.\n    In a Sept. 3 letter to customers, Liang said the short-seller report “contains false or inaccurate statements about our company,” and that “we will address these statements in due course.”\n    Liang said the company didn’t anticipate making any significant changes in its previously released financial results for fiscal 2024.\n    Luong in his lawsuit alleged Super Micro in some instances recognized revenue improperly from fiscal 2020 to 2022. He said in some cases it booked revenue on sales that hadn’t been completed. He said another method for booking revenue prematurely “was to ship and bill certain customers for incomplete equipment that was not ready for sale.”\n    Luong said Super Micro fired him in April 2023, after placing him on unpaid leave months earlier. His last job there was as a general manager responsible for providing leadership and guidance for Super Micro’s global service team.\n    Super Micro has asked the court to put Luong’s lawsuit on hold and send his claims to arbitration. A hearing on the company’s request is scheduled for Thursday.\n    Tanya Gomerman, an attorney for Luong, said in a statement, “Mr. Luong came forward to report what he believed were significant accounting irregularities, and instead of taking steps to investigate or fix these problems they terminated him and swept the matter under the rug.” \n\n4. Supermicro denies wrongdoing, despite the DoJ probe \n    (Bloomberg) -- Super Micro Computer Inc. said an independent review of its business found no evidence of misconduct but recommended that the server maker appoint new top financial and legal leadership.\n    A review by a special board committee, alongside attorneys from Cooley LLP and forensic accounting firm Secretariat Advisors, found “no evidence of misconduct on the part of management or the board of directors and that the audit committee acted independently.” \n    As a result of the findings, the committee recommended Super Micro install a new chief financial officer, chief compliance officer, and general counsel, it said in a statement Monday. “The board has instructed management to add additional experienced, senior talent commensurate with the Company’s size and complexity today and to prepare for its future growth,” Super Micro said in the statement.\n    The shares jumped as much as 22.5% on Monday in New York.\n    Super Micro does not expect changes to previously issued financial results for the most recent fiscal year, it said. Kenneth Cheung, formerly vice president of finance, will be the company’s new chief accounting officer. And the company has begun the process to search for a new CFO to replace David Weigand.\n    It’s been a tumultuous year for Super Micro. The maker of high-powered servers missed an August deadline to file its annual financial report and its auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, resigned in October, citing concerns about the company’s governance and transparency. The company is also facing a US Department of Justice probe following a damaging report from short seller Hindenburg Research.\n    EY communicated concerns to Super Micro’s audit committee in July. In response, the board investigated revenue recognition practices, export control policies, the rehiring of employees who had resigned following earlier accounting issues, and disclosure of related party transactions. The investigation determined that “the conclusions EY stated in its resignation letter were not supported by the facts examined in the review.”\n    In November, Super Micro appointed BDO USA as its independent auditor and submitted a plan to come into compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements. Completing the internal investigation clears a major hurdle to filing its audited financials, wrote Woo Jin Ho, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n    When investigating the rehiring of nine individuals who had resigned from the company following a 2017 investigation, the special committee found that the decisions to rehire were “the product of reasonable business judgment.”\n    Still, there were lapses “in ensuring guardrails were always in place and observed,” the special committee found. That includes not informing EY before entering into a consulting arrangement with Super Micro’s former CFO, who had resigned following the 2017 investigation. That arrangement has since been terminated. \n    Chief Financial Officer David Weigand held “primary responsibility” for these lapses, the committee found. He will continue to serve as the Company’s CFO until the board has named his successor, Super Micro said. The committee found “no evidence indicating that any process lapse resulted from bad faith, improper motives, or lack of regard for accurate financial reporting or compliance.”\n    In 2020, Super Micro paid $17.5 million to resolve a US Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into its financial accounting and disclosures for fiscal years 2014 through 2017. Super Micro didn’t admit to or deny the regulator’s allegations as part of its settlement.\n    In addition to appointing new financial and legal leadership, the company will improve its training related to sales and revenue recognition policies. The investigation involved analysis of over 9 million documents and 68 witness interviews, Super Micro said. It also included “extensive meetings” with Deloitte & Touche LLP and EY, the company’s former auditors.",

million SEC settlement, Super Micro began re-hiring top executives that were directly involved in the accounting scandal, per litigation records and interviews with former employees. A former salesperson told us: \\u201CAlmost all of them are back. Almost all of the people that were let go that were the cause of this malfeasance.\\u201D According to a lawsuit filed in April 2024, Super Micro waited only 3 months after the SEC settlement before restarting \\u201Cimproper revenue recognition,\\u201D \\u201Crecognizing incomplete sales,\\u201D and \\u201Ccircumvention of internal accounting controls\\u201D. Even after the SEC settlement, pressure to meet quotas pushed salespeople to stuff the channel with distributors using \\u201Cpartial shipments\\u201D or by shipping defective products around quarter-end, per our interviews with former employees and customers. One former salesperson described pushing products to distributors based on made-up demand forecasts, completing a partial shipment, then later coming up with an excuse for why the rest didn\\u2019t happen. \\u201CAnd now you have a problem. Accounting problem maybe.\\u201D Former employees told us Super Micro\\u2019s business culture has not improved. Former senior sales director: \\u201CI don\\u2019t think the behavior of the company in many ways has changed in the 5 years since I started, and I started shortly after that delisting problem.\\u201D Three senior employees who left in early 2018 amidst the accounting scandal were rehired, individually serving as (1) a member of the board of directors (2) a consultant serving close to the CEO (3) and a VP of business development. Former CFO Howard Hideshima left the company in January 2018 and was later individually charged by the SEC with accounting violations. In May 2023, he was hired by a key related party owned by Super Micro CEO\\u2019s brother. A new CFO, praised by co-workers for his integrity, was hired in January 2018 to help the company recover from the scandal. He helped Super Micro re-list but resigned in January 2021. A former sales director suggested that he was edged out by the company. Beyond fresh questions around its revenue accounting, we found that Super Micro\\u2019s relationships with both disclosed and undisclosed related parties serve as fertile ground for dubious accounting.

Ablecom is also partly owned by Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and his wife. The relationships seem oddly circular. Super Micro provides components to the entities which assemble them and sell them back to Super Micro. They also rent warehousing and factory space to Super Micro even though it has its own sprawling factory. The related parties seem to do little other business: ~99.8% of Ablecom\\u2019s exports to the U.S. since 2020 were to Super Micro, and ~99.7% of Compuware\\u2019s U.S. exports were to Super Micro, per trade records. In addition to the concerns around the disclosed related parties, we found evidence of undisclosed related parties. The youngest brother of Super Micro\\u2019s CEO owns two Taiwan-based entities that make server components. Media reports and former employees indicate the entities are Super Micro suppliers. Both entities operate out of the Super Micro Science and Technology Park in Taiwan, but Super Micro has not disclosed related party transactions with them. Another brother of Super Micro\\u2019s CEO operates a disclosed related party but is also the director and shareholder of undisclosed Hong Kong and Taiwanese entities, which appear to resell Super Micro products and provide \\u201Cprofessional OEM services.\\u201D It operates out of the same building as related party Compuware.

sub-lease it to Lambda. The CFO glossed over questions about the reason for this arrangement. In October 2023, two related parties run by CEO Liang\\u2019s brothers, one of them partially owned by Super Micro\\u2019s CEO, reportedly invested in small Taiwanese tech company Leadtek. Leadtek\\u2019s website advertises products almost identical to Super Micro\\u2019s, yet Super Micro discloses no relationship with Leadtek in what appears to be a clear undisclosed related party. Super Micro has claimed its liquid cooling technology will \\u201Crevolutionize the industry\\u201D and is its \\u201Ccompetitive edge.\\u201D But at a recent industry conference, Super Micro featured related party Ablecom\\u2019s liquid cooling solutions, per an Ablecom engineer. Ablecom has several patents for its liquid cooling technology. Despite this, Super Micro has never disclosed any related party involvement in its liquid cooling technology. Besides questions around related parties and proprietary product offerings, in 2006, Super Micro pleaded guilty to a felony count of exporting banned components to Iran. The CEO said the company was in its infancy and had learned from its mistakes. When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. government imposed stringent restrictions and bans on exports to Russia of high-performance computers and components. Super Micro disclosed that some of its products were subject to export bans and said it was halting all sales and had \\u201Cnot recorded revenue\\u201D from Russia since the day before the war started. Exports of Super Micro\\u2019s high-tech components to Russia have spiked ~3x since the invasion of Ukraine, apparently violating U.S. export bans, according to our review of more than 45,000 import/export transactions. At least 46 companies that handled Super Micro products to Russia since the invasion are now under OFAC sanctions or on U.S. government watchlists. Almost two-thirds of Super Micro\\u2019s exports to Russia since the invasion correspond to \\u201Chigh priority\\u201D components that the Russian military may be diverting to the battlefield, per U.S. government warnings. One of the biggest importers of Super Micro products in Russia is a supplier to one of Russia\\u2019s largest \\u201Csupercomputers\\u201D at a once-secret, now-sanctioned research center.

Tesla had been sourcing its servers exclusively from Super Micro, per Barclays Research in September 2023. But recent reports in May 2024 and posts by Elon Musk show Dell has now won major deals from Tesla, and Musk\\u2019s xAI, eroding Super Micro\\u2019s exclusivity. Super Micro has conceded that it is \\u201Cunder-indexed\\u201D with the world\\u2019s largest technology companies, called \\u201Chyperscalers.\\u201D Amazon AWS was a customer but cut ties after delivery issues, per a former employee.

Genesis Cloud is touted as a \\u201Csuccess story\\u201D on Super Micro\\u2019s website. But current and former employees told us otherwise: \\u201CCatastrophic. It is, on the technical side, one of my worst experiences I\\u2019ve had\\u2026in the industry.\\u201D GMI Cloud, a start-up GPU cloud provider in Asia and the U.S., told us they experienced a malfunction rate of 17.5% on its orders of 256 Super Micro servers. GMI is now moving away from Super Micro to HPE less than a year after its first order, per an employee. NexGen Cloud, an Nvidia partner, disclosed in October 2023 that it was investing $1 billion to build an AI super-cloud in Europe with over 20,000 Nvidia GPUs. But a NexGen employee told us that sometimes up to half of the orders received from Super Micro had firmware issues.

SeeJordan Decl. \\xB6\\xB62-3. Defendants thereafter filed the present motion to compel arbitration of the state claim claims (Claims 2 and 3) and to stay this action, including the non-arbitrable SOX claim (Claim 1), pending completion of arbitration.II.LEGAL STANDARDThe Federal Arbitration Act (\\u201CFAA\\u201D) embodies a \\u201Cnational policy favoring arbitration and a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary.\\u201D AT&T Mobility, LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 345-46 (2011) (internal quotationmarks and citations omitted).\\u201CThe FAA, 9 U.S.C. \\xA7 1 et seq., requires federal district courts to stay judicial proceedings and compel arbitration of claims covered by a written and enforceable arbitration agreement.\\u201D Nguyen v. Barnes & Noble Inc., 763 F.3d 1171, 1175 (9th Cir. 2014).\\u201CGenerally, in deciding whether to compel arbitration, a court must determine two \\u2018gateway\\u2019issues: (1) whether there is an agreement to arbitrate between the parties; and (2) whether the agreement covers the dispute.\\u201D Brennan v. Opus Bank, 796 F.3d 1125, 1130 (9th Cir. 2015). The first of these issues is non-delegable and must be decided by the district court. See Ahlstrom v. DHI Mortg.

However, the parties agree that the SOX claim cannot be compelled to arbitration. See18 U.S.C. \\xA7 1514A(e)(2) (\\u201CNo predispute arbitration provision shall be valid or enforceable, if the agreement requires arbitration of a dispute arising under this section.\\u201D).The state law claims are asserted against only SMCI. Defendants move to compel arbitration of the state law claims, arguing that Luong and SMCI entered into an arbitration agreement that is governed by the FAA, the arbitration agreement is enforceable, and the state law claims fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement. Defendants move to stay this litigation, including the SOX claim, pending arbitration of the state law claims.Luong does not dispute that the asserted arbitration agreement is governed by the FAA, as \\u201C[e]mployment contracts, except for those covering workers engaged in transportation, are covered by the FAA.\\u201D See E.E.O.C. v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U.S. 279, 289 (2002). Nor does Luong dispute that hisstate law claims fall within the scope of the asserted arbitration agreement.However, he contends that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable on the grounds that it is unconscionable and that it violates SOX.He further contends that even if the Court grants Defendants\\u2019 motion to compel arbitration of the state law claims, the Court should deny Defendants\\u2019 motion to stay with respect to the SOX claim and instead allow the SOX claim to proceed in this Court. A.Luong and SMCIEntered into an Arbitration AgreementIn determining whether an arbitration agreement exists, a district court applies \\u201Cordinary state-law principles that govern the formation of contracts.\\u2019\\u201DReichert v. Rapid Invs., Inc., 56 F.4th 1220, 1227(9th Cir. 2022)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).Under California law, an arbitration agreement generally must be memorialized in writing. See Pinnacle Museum Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Mkt. Dev.

Id.\\u201CAn arbitration clause within a contract may be binding on a party even if the party never actually read the clause.\\u201D Id.\\u201CThe party seeking arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement, and the party opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving any defense, such as unconscionability.\\u201D Id.SMCI submitsthe following documents:a copy of the offer letter signed by Luong, acknowledging that his offer of employment was contingent on his signing all required employment documents, including documents containingan arbitration agreement, seeChan Decl. \\xB6 3 & Ex. 1 (Offer Letter); a copy of theEmployee Acknowledgement Form signed by Luong, expressly agreeing to final and binding arbitration of disputes with SMCI as a condition of his employment, seeChan Decl. \\xB6 5 & Ex. 2 (Employee Acknowledgement Form); and a copy of the Arbitration of Disputes policy contained in the employee handbook and incorporated into the Employee Acknowledgement Form, Chan Decl. Ex. 3 (Policy). This evidence satisfies Defendants\\u2019 burden to prove the existence of an arbitration agreement between Luong and SMCI. Luong does not dispute signing the offer letter or Employee Acknowledgement Form. He submits a declaration statement that he \\u201Cwas not provided with the employee handbook containing the Arbitration of Disputes Policy referenced in the purported arbitration agreement and was not aware of the terms contained therein prior to signing the purported arbitration agreement.\\u201D Luong Decl. \\xB64, ECF 23-1. This statement is insufficient to undermine Defendants\\u2019 showing that the parties entered into an arbitration agreement, as the Employee Acknowledgement Form signed by Luong states expressly that Luong did receive the Arbitration of Disputes policy and agreed to be bound by it. See Pinnacle, 55 Cal. 4th at 236(\\u201CAn arbitration clause within a contract may be binding on a party even if the party never actually read the clause.\\u201D); see also Sanchez v. Valencia Holding Co., LLC, 61 Cal. 4th 899, 915 (2015) (rejecting argument that plaintiff did not read arbitration clause, observing that \\u201Cit is generally unreasonable . . . to neglect to read a written contract before signing it\\u201D).B.The Arbitration Agreement is EnforceableIf the party seeking arbitration meets its burden to prove the existence of an arbitration agreement, the party opposing arbitration bears the burden to prove any defense.See Pinnacle, 55 712345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728United States District CourtNorthern District of CaliforniaCal. 4th at 236. Luong argues that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because it is unconscionable and because it violates SOX. Neither argument is meritorious.1.Unconscionability\\u201C[G]enerally applicable contract defenses, such as . . . unconscionability, may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening the FAA or California law.\\u201D OTO, L.L.C. v. Kho, 8 Cal. 5th 111, 125 (2019) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted, alterations in original). \\u201CBoth procedural and substantive unconscionability must be shown for the defense to be established[.]\\u201D Id.\\u201CThe procedural element addresses the circumstances of contract negotiation and formation, focusing onoppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power.\\u201D Id.(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \\u201CSubstantive unconscionability pertains to the fairness of an agreement\\u2019s actual terms and to assessments of whether they are overly harsh or one-sided.\\u201DId.(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \\u201CThe burden of proving unconscionability rests upon the party asserting it.\\u201D Id.at 126. Luong asserts that the procedural unconscionability requirement is met because he was required to sign the Employee Acknowledgement Form containing the arbitration agreementas a condition of employment, and because the Arbitration of Disputes policy was \\u201Cburied\\u201D in the employee handbook and \\u201Cmerely incorporated by reference\\u201D into the Employee Acknowledgement Form. Taking those arguments in reverse order, the Court finds Luong\\u2019s characterization of the arbitration policy as \\u201Cburied\\u201D in the employee handbook to be inaccurate. The policy is 5 pages in length, contains subheadings that make its various provisions easyto access, and concludes with a bolded paragraph written in all capital letters that unequivocally provides for binding arbitration. The 1-page Employee Acknowledgement Form calls out the key aspects of the arbitration agreement, specifically that it is a condition of employment and encompasses all disputes arising out of employment or termination of employment. Given Luong\\u2019s signature on the 1-page Employee Acknowledgement Form directly above the paragraph addressing arbitration, his assertion that he did not have notice of thatterm of employment is wholly unpersuasive.Moreover, that fact that the arbitration agreementwas a condition of employment does not render it procedurally unconscionable. \\u201CArbitration contracts imposed as a condition of 812345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728United States District CourtNorthern District of Californiaemployment are typically adhesive.\\u201D OTO, 8 Cal. 5th at 126. \\u201CThe pertinent question, then, is whether circumstances of the contract\\u2019s formation created such oppression or surprise that closer scrutiny of its overall fairness is required.\\u201D Id.\\u201CThe circumstances relevant to establishing oppression include, but are not limited to (1) the amount of time the party is given to consider the proposed contract; (2) the amount and type of pressure exerted on the party to sign the proposed contract; (3) the length of the proposed contract and the length and complexity of the challenged provision; (4) the education and experience of the party; and (5) whether the party\\u2019s review of the proposed contract was aided by an attorney.\\u201DId.at 126-27. Luong had more than a week between the date the offer of employment was extended, December 19, 2012, and the date he accepted, December 28, 2012. There is no evidence that any pressure was exerted on him to sign the offer letter and Employee Acknowledgement Form. The offerletter is 2 pages in length and the Employee Acknowledgement Form containing the arbitration agreement is 1 page in length. Luong is an educated, sophisticated individual who accepted a position with a base salary of $170,000. It is unclear whether Luong engaged an attorney to help him review the proposed contract, but he certainly had the opportunity to do so. Based on this record, the Court finds that Luong has failed to carry his burden of proving procedural unconscionability.Nor has Luong proved substantive unconscionability.\\u201CIn evaluating substantive unconscionability, courts often look to whether the arbitration agreement meets certain minimum levels of fairness.\\u201D Murrey v. Superior Ct., 87 Cal. App. 5th 1223, 1247-48 (2023). \\u201C[A]t a minimum, a mandatory employment arbitration agreement must (1) provide for neutral arbitrators, (2) provide for more than minimal discovery, (3) require a written award that permits limited judicial review, (4) provide for all of the types of relief that would otherwise be available in court, and (5) require the employer to pay the arbitrator\\u2019s fees and all costs unique to arbitration.\\u201D Id.(citation omitted). Luong argues that the arbitration agreement at issue heredoes not provide for adequate discoveryand may require him to pay costs unique to arbitration, such asDefendants\\u2019 costs incurred in responding to his discovery requestsand administrative and facility fees.The California Supreme Court has rejected the notion that anarbitration agreementis unconscionable merely because it grants the arbitrator discretion over what discovery may be taken. See 912345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728United States District CourtNorthern District of CaliforniaArmendariz v. Found. Health Psychcare Servs., Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 83, 105 & n.10 (2000). With respect to the costs of arbitration, the Arbitration of Disputes policy states that the employee \\u201Cwill not be responsible for any part of the arbitrator\\u2019s fees and costs.\\u201D Chan Decl. Ex. 3 (Policy). The policy does require that each side pay its own discovery costs, as is customary in litigation. See id.The Court does not read the policy to require Luong to pay Defendants\\u2019 costs in responding to discovery requests, or any costs that are unique to arbitration, and Luong has not pointed to any provision of the policy clearly imposing such costs on him.The reliance Luong places on Ronderos v. USF Reddaway, Inc., 114 F.4th 1080 (9th Cir. 2024), and similar cases is misplaced, as those cases involved unsophisticated individuals in factual circumstances dissimilar to this case. See, e.g., Ronderos, 114 F.4th 1080 (applicant for position of line haul manager pushed to sign agreement immediately and on site); OTO, 8 Cal. 5th 111 (agreement presented to low level worker at his workspace with expectation that he sign it immediately).2.Asserted Violation of SOXLuong contends that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because it encompasses all claims arising out of his employment, including his SOX claim, and thus runs afoul of SOX\\u2019s prohibition against arbitration agreements. The relevant provision of SOX reads as follows: \\u201CNo predispute arbitration agreement shall be valid or enforceable, if the agreement requires arbitration of a dispute arising under this section.\\u201D 18 U.S.C.A. \\xA7 1514A(e)(2).According to Luong, that provision invalidates the arbitration agreementat issue hereentirely, with respect to bothhisSOX claim and his non-SOX claims.Luong relies on out-of-circuit decisions from the District of Puerto Ricoand the Western District of Arkansas to support his position. See Stewart v. Doral Fin. Corp., 997 F. Supp. 2d 129 (D.P.R. 2014); Laubenstein v. Conair Corp., No. 5:14-CV-05227, 2014 WL 6609164(W.D. Ark. Nov. 19, 2014). Those decisions applied \\xA71514A(e)(2) to invalidate arbitration agreements as to both SOX claims and non-SOX claims where the claims arose from the same facts, reasoning that under those circumstances allowing arbitration of the non-SOX claims would frustrate the purpose of \\xA71514A(e)(2). 1012345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728United States District CourtNorthern District of CaliforniaDefendants arguethat Luong\\u2019s reading of the SOX prohibition against arbitration agreements is too broad, relying primarily on a California district court decision thatrejected the approach of Stewartand Laubenstein. See Endresen v. Banc of California, Inc., No. SACV 18-00899-CJC(DFMx), 2018 WL 11399501, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 20, 2018). The Endresencourt emphasized that the prohibition on arbitration set forth in \\xA71514A(e)(2)is expressly limited to claims arising under SOX, and that \\u201C[d]enying arbitration on some claims because there are also non-arbitrable claims ignores the FAA\\u2019s \\u2018emphatic federal policy\\u2019in favor of arbitration.\\u201D Id.The Endresencourt acknowledged that the FAAmay be overridden by a clear congressional command,but concluded that SOX does not contain a clear congressional mandate that would extend \\xA71514A(e)(2)beyond the scope of claims brought under SOX. See id.This Court agrees with the reasoning of Endresen, specifically the conclusion that it would be improper to refuse to enforce a valid arbitration agreement as required under the FAA, absent a clear congressional mandate. In this Court\\u2019s view, a judicial determination that the purpose of SOX\\u2019s anti-arbitration provision might be frustrated by compelling arbitration of non-SOX claims arising from the same facts is an insufficient basis to override the FAA. Moreover, this Court agrees with the Endresencourt\\u2019s observation that \\u201Cit is not clear why arbitration of non-SOX claims would frustrate any purpose of section 1514A, since Plaintiff\\u2019s SOX claim still remains before the court.\\u201D Endresen, 2018 WL 11399501, at *3C.The State Law Claims Fall Within the Scope of the Arbitration AgreementThere is no dispute that Luong\\u2019s state law claims for retaliation, which clearly arise out of his employment and termination, fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement, and the Court finds that the state law claims do fall within the scope of theagreement. Accordingly, the Court will grant Defendants\\u2019 motion to compel arbitration of Luong\\u2019s state law claims.D.A Stay of this Action, Including theSOX Claim, is WarrantedDefendants move to stay this action, including the SOX claim, pending arbitration of the state law claims.Luong opposes a stay of litigation of his SOX claim, asking the Court to allow his SOX claim to proceed in this forum while his state law claims proceed in arbitration.Where a complaint asserts both arbitrable and non-arbitrable claims, the defendants are not 1112345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728United States District CourtNorthern District of Californiaentitled to a stay of the non-arbitrable claims as of right, but the district court may in its discretion stay the non-arbitrable claims \\u201Cunder the powers to control its own docket and to provide for the prompt and efficient determination of the cases pending before it.\\u201D Leyva v. Certified Grocers of California, Ltd., 593 F.2d 857, 863 (9th Cir. 1979). \\u201CA stay should not be granted unless it appears likely the other proceedings will be concluded within a reasonable time in relation to the urgency of the claims presented to the court.\\u201D Id.at 864. In Leyva, the Ninth Circuit found that \\u201C[i]t would waste judicial resources and be burdensome upon the parties if the district court in a case such as this were mandated to permit discovery, and upon completion of pretrial proceedings, to take evidence and determine the merits of the case at the same time as the arbitrator is going through a substantially parallel process.\\u201D Id.Other courts in this district have found it appropriate to stay a SOX claim pending arbitration of non-SOX claims arising from the same facts. See, e.g., Anderson v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 18-CV-06712-PJH, 2018 WL 6728015, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 21, 2018). The Andersoncourt found it \\u201Cappropriate to stay plaintiff\\u2019s SOX claim and the entire action because plaintiff\\u2019s claims all arise from the same conduct and because allowing the arbitration to resolve will simplify issues of law or questions of fact in future proceedings.\\u201D Id.As in Anderson, Luong\\u2019snon-arbitrable SOX claim and arbitrable state law claims arise from the same conduct, and staying litigation of the SOX claim pending arbitration of the state law claims may simplify questions of fact and/or issues of law in future proceedings. Luongargues that such simplification would prejudice his ability to litigate his SOX claim, because discovery in the arbitration will be far more limited than discovery available in district court. He asserts that there is a substantial risk that his SOX claim will be subject to issue preclusion arising from an adverse arbitration decision on the non-SOX claims. Luong urgesthe Court to deny the requested stay of the SOX claim, citing an out-of-circuitdecision in which the court found it appropriate toallow the SOX claim to be litigated in parallel with arbitration of the non-SOX claims. See Vuoncino v. Forterra, Inc., No. 3:21-CV-01046-K, 2022 WL 868274, at *8 (N.D. Tex. Feb. 28, 2022), report and recommendation adopted, No. 3:21-CV-01046-K, 2022 WL 865893 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 22, 2022). 1212345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728United States District CourtNorthern District of CaliforniaWhile Luong\\u2019s prejudice argumenthas some facial appeal, he has not demonstrated that he is likely to be prejudiced by any limitations in the arbitration proceeding. His prejudice argument is premised on the assumption that he will not prevail in arbitration,and thus will be denied a fair opportunity to litigate his SOX claim because he will be bound by an adverse arbitration decision based on limited discovery. Luong\\u2019s apparent assumption that he will lose at arbitration is not founded on any record evidence. Moreover, when the Court inquired at the hearing whether the arbitrator\\u2019s decision onthenon-SOX claims would be binding on this Court during subsequent litigation of the SOX claim, Luong\\u2019s counsel was unable to direct the Court to any controlling authority. Accordingly, the Court finds Luong\\u2019s argument of prejudice to be purely speculative. The Court in the exercise of its discretion finds that a stay of this litigation, including the SOX claim, is warranted for reasons of economy and efficiency. Luong\\u2019s SOX claim arises from the same facts as his non-SOX claims,and under those circumstances allowing this case to proceed in parallel to the arbitration likely would result in a waste of judicial resources and imposition of an undue burden on Defendants. Important to this decision is the representation of Defendants\\u2019 counsel at the hearing that the parties are poised to commence arbitration as soon as the Court issues its ruling. The Court will require the parties to begin arbitration within 60 days after this order.IV.ORDER(1) Defendants\\u2019 motion to compel arbitration and stay action is GRANTED.

The SEC also reached a settlement with a former Super Micro chief financial officer, and it required Liang to reimburse the company $2.1 million in stock-sale profits even though it didn\\u2019t accuse Liang of misconduct. In his lawsuit, Luong said Super Micro fired several employees associated with the past accounting violations, only to hire them back later. Hindenburg highlighted the same point in its report. Hindenburg also said it had found instances of Super Micro products being shipped to companies in Russia after the war in Ukraine began, despite U.S. sanctions. On Aug. 28, the day after the Hindenburg report, Super Micro said it would be late filing its fiscal 2024 annual report with the SEC. The company soon afterward said its board of directors had formed a committee \\u201Cto review certain of the company\\u2019s internal controls and other matters.\\u201D The company still hasn\\u2019t filed its annual report. In a Sept. 3 letter to customers, Liang said the short-seller report \\u201Ccontains false or inaccurate statements about our company,\\u201D and that \\u201Cwe will address these statements in due course.\\u201D Liang said the company didn\\u2019t anticipate making any significant changes in its previously released financial results for fiscal 2024. Luong in his lawsuit alleged Super Micro in some instances recognized revenue improperly from fiscal 2020 to 2022. He said in some cases it booked revenue on sales that hadn\\u2019t been completed. He said another method for booking revenue prematurely \\u201Cwas to ship and bill certain customers for incomplete equipment that was not ready for sale.\\u201D Luong said Super Micro fired him in April 2023, after placing him on unpaid leave months earlier. His last job there was as a general manager responsible for providing leadership and guidance for Super Micro\\u2019s global service team. Super Micro has asked the court to put Luong\\u2019s lawsuit on hold and send his claims to arbitration. A hearing on the company\\u2019s request is scheduled for Thursday. Tanya Gomerman, an attorney for Luong, said in a statement, \\u201CMr. Luong came forward to report what he believed were significant accounting irregularities, and instead of taking steps to investigate or fix these problems they terminated him and swept the matter under the rug.\\u201D\"]})}),(0,a.jsx)(m.li,{children:(0,a.jsx)(m.p,{children:\"Supermicro denies wrongdoing, despite the DoJ probe (Bloomberg) -- Super Micro Computer Inc. said an independent review of its business found no evidence of misconduct but recommended that the server maker appoint new top financial and legal leadership. A review by a special board committee, alongside attorneys from Cooley LLP and forensic accounting firm Secretariat Advisors, found \\u201Cno evidence of misconduct on the part of management or the board of directors and that the audit committee acted independently.\\u201D As a result of the findings, the committee recommended Super Micro install a new chief financial officer, chief compliance officer, and general counsel, it said in a statement Monday. \\u201CThe board has instructed management to add additional experienced, senior talent commensurate with the Company\\u2019s size and complexity today and to prepare for its future growth,\\u201D Super Micro said in the statement. The shares jumped as much as 22.5% on Monday in New York. Super Micro does not expect changes to previously issued financial results for the most recent fiscal year, it said. Kenneth Cheung, formerly vice president of finance, will be the company\\u2019s new chief accounting officer. And the company has begun the process to search for a new CFO to replace David Weigand. It\\u2019s been a tumultuous year for Super Micro. The maker of high-powered servers missed an August deadline to file its annual financial report and its auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, resigned in October, citing concerns about the company\\u2019s governance and transparency. The company is also facing a US Department of Justice probe following a damaging report from short seller Hindenburg Research. EY communicated concerns to Super Micro\\u2019s audit committee in July. In response, the board investigated revenue recognition practices, export control policies, the rehiring of employees who had resigned following earlier accounting issues, and disclosure of related party transactions. The investigation determined that \\u201Cthe conclusions EY stated in its resignation letter were not supported by the facts examined in the review.\\u201D In November, Super Micro appointed BDO USA as its independent auditor and submitted a plan to come into compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements. Completing the internal investigation clears a major hurdle to filing its audited financials, wrote Woo Jin Ho, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. When investigating the rehiring of nine individuals who had resigned from the company following a 2017 investigation, the special committee found that the decisions to rehire were \\u201Cthe product of reasonable business judgment.\\u201D Still, there were lapses \\u201Cin ensuring guardrails were always in place and observed,\\u201D the special committee found. That includes not informing EY before entering into a consulting arrangement with Super Micro\\u2019s former CFO, who had resigned following the 2017 investigation. That arrangement has since been terminated. Chief Financial Officer David Weigand held \\u201Cprimary responsibility\\u201D for these lapses, the committee found. He will continue to serve as the Company\\u2019s CFO until the board has named his successor, Super Micro said. The committee found \\u201Cno evidence indicating that any process lapse resulted from bad faith, improper motives, or lack of regard for accurate financial reporting or compliance.\\u201D In 2020, Super Micro paid $17.5 million to resolve a US Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into its financial accounting and disclosures for fiscal years 2014 through 2017. Super Micro didn\\u2019t admit to or deny the regulator\\u2019s allegations as part of its settlement. In addition to appointing new financial and legal leadership, the company will improve its training related to sales and revenue recognition policies. The investigation involved analysis of over 9 million documents and 68 witness interviews, Super Micro said. It also included \\u201Cextensive meetings\\u201D with Deloitte & Touche LLP and EY, the company\\u2019s former auditors.\"})})]})]})}function o(e={}){let{wrapper:m}=e.components||{};return m?(0,a.jsx)(m,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}return b(v);})();\n;return Component;"
