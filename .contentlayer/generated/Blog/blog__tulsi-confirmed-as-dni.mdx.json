Trump’s pick to lead the Pentagon until after a thorough vetting.\n\n> Ms. Collins characterized the session as a “good, substantive discussion.”\n\n> But it was clear that Mr. Hegseth had not yet won her support. Afterward, he told reporters that he had no idea how Ms. Collins would eventually come down on his nomination.\n\n> On Tuesday, he met with Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who is also considered a potential holdout. Like Ms. Collins, Ms. Murkowski declined to endorse Mr. Hegseth afterward, saying they “had a good exchange, and we’ll see what the process bears.”\n\n> He had better luck with Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, who after initially sounding hostile to his bid and pointedly declining to support him after their first meeting came out on Monday signaling a more positive view.\n\n\nImplication: \nCollins is likely to reject him (~60?), but wants to give the impression that she is \"vetting\" him. If you found his behavior acceptable, would you \"vet\" the candidate, or reject them immediately?\n\nUnlike Collins, however, Senator Joni Ernst from Iowa has succumbed to the pressure since she has an upcoming senate race and doesn't want to anger the maga crowd.\n\nAt this point, we need to wait for the senate hearings. That is make or break for Hegseth.\n\nRe. Ernst, if Collins makes the larger push against Hegseth and she follows, they can successfully bar Hegseth from the DoD.\n\nSure, Trump \"brought his nomination from the brink\", but that doesn't mean it won't be dead in the senate chamber.\n\n\n**Note: Hegseth can lose 3 GOP senate votes, if all democrats vote against him. lose 4, and it's game over.**\n\nEven if sentiment is positive for him right now, it doesn't mean negative sentiment will fail to materialize before his confirmation.\n",
