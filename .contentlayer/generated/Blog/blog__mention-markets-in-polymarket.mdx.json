This may seem like a simple fact, and already 'priced-in', but Polymarket suffers badly from recency bias.\n\nIf Trump doesn't say something in one rally, it's likely that its mention market odds for the next rally will be very low. The opposite is true if Trump says something a lot.\n\nThe key is to make small bets with high extrinsic value.\n\nBy \"small bets\", I mean you should bet based on the kelly criterion, but 1/2 or 1/4th of the recommended amount. This will prevent you from [blowing up](/data/blog/blowing-up-the-single-most-important-hedge).\n\nBy \"high extrinsic value\", I mean to bet on something with asymmetric upside. A simple example is if a rally is purportedly focusing on the economy, bet against the speaker saying border-related topics.\n\nLook at base rates to ensure the odds are well-priced in your favor. I won't say a lot about this - you need a way to accurately measure every previous mention of the word you're betting on.\n\n### Examples, personal bets\nThe best example of a good bet I made on a mention market is on Trump's rally in Prarie Du Chen, Wisconsin.\nLooking at the [press release](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/24f093a1-d3ed-4e1c-b58d-4975bc18d0cd), (which apparently nobody looks at), it was obvious that the speech would be limited to remarks on the border,\n\nin addition to other current events, since Trump likes to ramble about those. \n\nYou can also see that the stage that Trump was performing at was very small, in fact, he was speaking at an elementary school. This implies he does not have a large audience to rile up, so extreme rhetoric will\nbe avoided.\n\nIn light of this information, I bought a lot of NO shares on Trump saying \"Tax Queen\", for ~30c per share. I bought 3500 shares, for a total cost of ~$1000.\n\nThe price was trading at ~70/30 for Yes/No, since Trump said it in his last rally (his last appearance was about remarks on the tax code, which is why he said the term.)\n\n## Dangers and ad-hoc narratives\n\nThe most common mistake I make *currently* as a bettor on mention market is bidding on markets with bad odds. Trump can say anything at a rally, you never know what comes on his mind.\nEven if the base rates for a specific word are low, betting against him saying something for a high price is unwise. I made this mistake recently, in fact, betting against him saying \"Vance\".\nHe said it, and I lost $1000 since shares were going for 50c. (For context, he generally says \"j.d.\" or doesn't mention him)\n\nIt's also important not to create ad-hoc narratives i.e. a contrived thesis. For example, if Trump is speaking at some event in Pennsylvania, more likely than not, his remarks will follow previous rallies.\nThere's no need to bet harder on things like the economy and the border at bad odds - as previously mentioned:\n\n> there are tons of opportunities to profit in MMs. Don't waste your money and over-bet.\n\nI've personally lost tons of money betting against Trump saying \"transgender\", because I placed value in where exactly he was making the rally, and in what setting, instead of considering the nature of the remark,\nwhich is to rile up voters at the *end* of his rallies as part of his prepared teleprompter remarks.\n\nThese markets are competitive in nature; if you give out tips for free, markets will become more efficient and you will lose income opportunities.\n\nIn fact, I would argue that if newcomers or irrational bettors didn't exist, the odds would fall out of my favor and I would not be able to make any lucrative bets.\n\n\n## Future of mention markets\n\nAfter making ~$8000 from various bets on mention markets, I found that many veterans began to stop betting on them.\nI guess it's because base rate bets kept failing and there was no empirical evidence that their strategy worked.\n\nWhales on these markets, like [HaterzLoserz](https://polymarket.com/profile/0xe64ffa7621459172ad81960762d5760e65d444a5) and [anon1565](https://polymarket.com/profile/0x7bda5bceac127c3fc41d7fe7ac335593aaaa121b)\nhave stopped betting on them, at least right now, Oct 17 2024.\n\nThe viability of these markets will come into question throughout the next few months - will polymarket stop promoting them given how unfavorable they are to newcomers?",
