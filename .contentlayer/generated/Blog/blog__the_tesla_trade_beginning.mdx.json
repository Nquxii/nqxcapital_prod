Full portfolio puts. 50% into 290 strike puts, 15% into calender puts, 35% into vertical spreads.\n\n# Elon versus Trump\nElon and Trump had a public feud recently, causing Tesla to implode by ~14% in a single day.\n\n> Multiple allies caught in the middle of the implosion between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk were delicately attempting to broker peace between the two men today when their quiet conversations were disrupted by a post on X.\n> “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” Musk wrote, stunning those with close relationships to Trump and Musk.\n> Several people familiar with what was happening behind the scenes — who were desperately making phone calls to one another and trying to tamp down the escalating feud — described that as the tipping point, fearing that there was no going back after Musk’s loaded accusation about the president regarding the so-called Epstein files.\n> While Trump and Musk had largely argued over policy, it had now turned personal.\n> Officials in the West Wing spent most today glued to their phones as they watched the battle between the two play out on X and Truth Social. Several aides were sending the updates in group chats, likening it to a divorce and commenting that they expected this would happen, just not this soon.\n> “I thought maybe August,” one noted to CNN.\n\nThe broader narrative here isn't that Elon has lost his influence with Trump. \n\nIt's that Elon is no longer fit to run the company.\n\nConsider the way Elon went about criticizing Trump. He first started with attacks about the bill, likely in response to the Trump admin slighting him by not picking Jared for NASA commissioner.\n\nTrump responds, of course, by defending his bill and making some unfriendly comments about Elon.\n\nThen, Elon goes on a tangent that could have been easily de-escalated beforehand. He says that Trump would never have won the election without him, and even goes on to imply that Trump is a pedophile, which is\nwhy he is not releasing the Epstein list. The way he makes this assertion makes it difficult to deny. It still has not been deleted from Twitter.\n\nIMO, both of these comments are highly damaging to Trump's perception of Elon. He's made a preventable mess. He, without calculation, attacked Trump and the admin on several occasions.\n\nThe admin has to clean up after Elon's comments, which, in the first place wouldn't have been significant if he had a proper temper.\n\nImagine the burden that the white house and Trump has to deal with now. They trusted each other enough to begin DOGE and bring on Elon as a formal adviser, and now, he has backstabbed them in an outlandish,\nchildish manner. Unless Trump does the heavy lifting, most likely, their relationship is severed.\n\nIn this case, the impact to the stock should be down, and fast. I can see a rebound to the 300 level, but there is just no strong narrative for the stock at this point, presuming Robotaxi event is a nothingburger.\nThere is nothing that indicates that Tesla is going to outperform expectations in early June.\n\nAdditionally, I do not see Trump reinstating the EV tax credits anytime soon. Elon should have talked to him privately about it before spazzing out on twitter.",
