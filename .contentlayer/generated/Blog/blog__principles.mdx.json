Understand that capital is scarce. Don't waste it on a bad opportunity. (kelly criterion and probability of blowing up even given a favorable bet)\n\n3. Don't blindly copy-trade someone else. Do your own research before coming to conclusions. *Everyone* is biased, and they are not in the same financial position as you. Their prediction could be based on \na variety of factors.\n\n4. Forget about your assumptions. What should/is the descion maker think is what matters (trump+jre bet) \n\n5. Do not focus on your potential profit.
