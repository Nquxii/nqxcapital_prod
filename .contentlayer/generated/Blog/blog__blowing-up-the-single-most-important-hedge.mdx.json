When you buy an option or bet on a prediction market, you are paying for a contract with no intrinsic value - only expectation.\n\nYou can't sell your bets on the presidential election after it is over.\n\nIn 2021, after the crypto boom, I was up ~400% on my initial investment of $2000. Instead of selling, however, I held my crypto and kept adding when prices fell.\n\nEventually, I ran out of money, and my only choice was to deposit money to FTX and begin leverage trading. At first I made small trades, with low amounts of leverage. \nBut as I lost money each trade, I began increasing the leverage - to 10x, even 20x. Thankfully, FTX had limited leverage to 20x at the time, but it wouldn't stop me from \nblowing up. I kept losing my trades as the crypto bubble finally popped, and I was left with $1200 in my trading accounts, from a high of $17,000.\n\nAt that point, I was focused on other obligations (high school), so I stopped trading and withdrew the rest of the money in my trading account.\n\nA few months later, FTX blew up, and it reminded me of what I had actually within the year. I built (what I concieved as) a fortune, and threw it away because I was greedy\nand wanted more than 13x in returns. Life has a funny way of working where you genuinely cannot win using greed, no matter how much you make. It always finds a way to ruin you.\n\nThe answer to this dilemma, this pleasing desire to bet more, is reminding yourself to limit your bets and avoid blowing up.\n\nIt's easier said than done, I know this firsthand. But you need to remind yourself of the worst-case scenario in any of your financial endeavors. \n\nDon't be greedy. Don't increase position sizing to \"make back your losses\". Don't make decisions based on your net worth goals instead of the quality of the decision.\n\nIt hurts, but when you blow up, you'll never have the capital to build long-lasting, generational wealth.\n\n![hyun](/static/images/silent_war.png)\n\nGamble safely.",
