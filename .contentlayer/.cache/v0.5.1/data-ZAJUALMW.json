It is kept for historical reasons, but is no longer supported. It also serves as a nice example of [Github Alert](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts). For the actual documentation, please refer to the [Github repository](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog).\n\nThis is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) blogging starter template. Probably the most feature-rich Next.js markdown blogging template out there. Comes out of the box configured with the latest technologies to make technical writing a breeze. Easily configurable and customizable. Perfect as a replacement to existing Jekyll and Hugo individual blogs.\n\nCheck out the documentation below to get started.\n\nFacing issues?

Feel free to create a PR and add your blog to this list.\n\n## Motivation\n\nI wanted to port my existing blog to Nextjs and Tailwind CSS but there was no easy out of the box template to use so I decided to create one. Design is adapted from [Tailwindlabs blog](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/blog.tailwindcss.com).\n\nI wanted it to be nearly as feature-rich as popular blogging templates like [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) and [Hugo Academic](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules) but with the best of React's ecosystem and current web development's best practices.\n\n## Features\n\n- Easy styling customization with [Tailwind 3.0](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v3) and primary color attribute\n- Near perfect lighthouse score - [Lighthouse report](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/210111_DiC1_08f3670c3430bf4a9b76fc3b927716c5/)\n- Lightweight, 45kB first load JS, uses Preact in production build\n- Mobile-friendly view\n- Light and dark theme\n- Self-hosted font with [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/)\n- Supports [plausible](https://plausible.io/), [simple analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com/) and google analytics\n- [MDX - write JSX in markdown documents!](https://mdxjs.com/)\n- Server-side syntax highlighting with line numbers and line highlighting via [rehype-prism-plus](https://github.com/timlrx/rehype-prism-plus)\n- Math display supported via [KaTeX](https://katex.org/)\n- Citation and bibliography support via [rehype-citation](https://github.com/timlrx/rehype-citation)\n- Automatic image optimization via [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization)\n- Flexible data retrieval with [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler)\n- Support for tags - each unique tag will be its own page\n- Support for multiple authors\n- Blog templates\n- TOC component\n- Support for nested routing of blog posts\n- Newsletter component with support for Mailchimp, Buttondown, Convertkit, Klaviyo, Revue, Emailoctopus and Beehiiv\n- Supports [giscus](https://github.com/laymonage/giscus), [utterances](https://github.com/utterance/utterances) or disqus\n- Projects page\n- Preconfigured security headers\n- SEO friendly with RSS feed, sitemaps and more!\n\n## Sample posts\n\n- [A markdown guide](https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog/github-markdown-guide)\n- [Learn more about images in Next.js](https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog/guide-to-using-images-in-nextjs)\n- [A tour of math typesetting](https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog/deriving-ols-estimator)\n- [Simple MDX image grid](https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog/pictures-of-canada)\n- [Example of long prose](https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog/the-time-machine)\n- [Example of Nested Route Post](https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog/nested-route/introducing-multi-part-posts-with-nested-routing)\n\n## Quick Start Guide\n\n1. JS (official support) - `npx degit https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.git` or TS (community support) - `npx degit timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog#typescript`\n2. Personalize `siteMetadata.js` (site related information)\n3. Modify the content security policy in `next.config.js` if you want to use\n   any analytics provider or a commenting solution other than giscus.\n4. Personalize `authors/default.md` (main author)\n5. Modify `projectsData.ts`\n6. Modify `headerNavLinks.ts` to customize navigation links\n7. Add blog posts\n8. Deploy on Vercel\n\n## Development\n\nFirst, run the development server:\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n# or\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.\n\nYou can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.\n\n## Extend / Customize\n\n`data/siteMetadata.js` - contains most of the site related information which should be modified for a user's need.\n\n`data/authors/default.md` - default author information (required). Additional authors can be added as files in `data/authors`.\n\n`data/projectsData.js` - data used to generate styled card on the projects page.\n\n`data/headerNavLinks.js` - navigation links.\n\n`data/logo.svg` - replace with your own logo.\n\n`data/blog` - replace with your own blog posts.\n\n`public/static` - store assets such as images and favicons.\n\n`tailwind.config.js` and `css/tailwind.css` - contain the tailwind stylesheet which can be modified to change the overall look and feel of the site.\n\n`css/prism.css` - controls the styles associated with the code blocks. Feel free to customize it and use your preferred prismjs theme e.g. [prism themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes).\n\n`components/social-icons` - to add other icons, simply copy an svg file from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) and map them in `index.js`. Other icons use [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).\n\n`components/MDXComponents.js` - pass your own JSX code or React component by specifying it over here. You can then call them directly in the `.mdx` or `.md` file. By default, a custom link and image component is passed.\n\n`layouts` - main templates used in pages.\n\n`pages` - pages to route to. Read the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for more information.\n\n`next.config.js` - configuration related to Next.js. You need to adapt the Content Security Policy if you want to load scripts, images etc. from other domains.\n\n## Post\n\n### Frontmatter\n\nFrontmatter follows [Hugo's standards](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/).\n\nCurrently 10 fields are supported.\n\n```\ntitle (required)\ndate (required)\ntags (required, can be empty array)\nlastmod (optional)\ndraft (optional)\nsummary (optional)\nimages (optional, if none provided defaults to socialBanner in siteMetadata config)\nauthors (optional list which should correspond to the file names in `data/authors`. Uses `default` if none is specified)\nlayout (optional list which should correspond to the file names in `data/layouts`)\ncanonicalUrl (optional, canonical url for the post for SEO)\n```\n\nHere's an example of a post's frontmatter:\n\n```\n---\ntitle: 'Introducing Tailwind Nexjs Starter Blog'\ndate: '2021-01-12'\nlastmod: '2021-01-18'\ntags: ['next-js', 'tailwind', 'guide']\ndraft: false\nsummary: 'Looking for a performant, out of the box template, with all the best in web technology to support your blogging needs? Checkout the Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog template.'\nimages: ['/static/images/canada/mountains.jpg', '/static/images/canada/toronto.jpg']\nauthors: ['default', 'sparrowhawk']\nlayout: PostLayout\ncanonicalUrl: https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog/introducing-tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog\n---\n```\n\n### Compose\n\nRun `node ./scripts/compose.js` to bootstrap a new post.\n\nFollow the interactive prompt to generate a post with pre-filled front matter.\n\n## Deploy\n\n**Vercel**  \nThe easiest way to deploy the template is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com) from the creators of Next.js. Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.\n\n**Netlify / GitHub Pages / Firebase etc.**  \nAs the template uses `next/image` for image optimization, additional configurations have to be made to deploy on other popular static hosting websites like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). An alternative image optimization provider such as Imgix, Cloudinary or Akamai has to be used. Alternatively, replace the `next/image` component with a standard `<img>` tag. See [`next/image` documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) for more details.\n\nThe API routes used in the newsletter component cannot be used in a static site export.

          "raw": "\n## Intro\nMention markets on polymarket are probably the most toxic and unsettling markets on the platform.\n\nThis is because an individual's rhetoric is highly volatile and unpredictable, and waiting for them to finish the speech or say some word is very nerve-racking.\n\nAdditionally, providing information to new bettors reduces the edge that top bettors have on these markets. This reduces the likelihood that a new bettors avoids these markets and sells his bets.\n\nOver time, however, good bettors have enough information to **easily** make money from bids, at least in the long-run.\n\n## Strategy\nThis is because speeches may be targeted based on the appearance. This may seem like a simple fact, and already 'priced-in', but polymarket suffers badly from recency bias.\n\nIf Trump doesn't say something in one rally, odds are that its odds for the next rally will be very low. The opposite is true if Trump says something a lot.\n\nThe key is to make small bets with high extrinsic value.\n\n\n### Examples, personal bets\nThe best example of a good bet I made on a mention market is on Trump's rally in Prarie Du Chen, Wisconsin.\nBy the [press release](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/24f093a1-d3ed-4e1c-b58d-4975bc18d0cd), (which apparently nobody looks at), it was obvious that the speech would be limited to remarks on the border,\n\nand current events, since Trump likes to ramble about those. \nYou can also see that the stage that Trump was performing at was very small, in fact, it was an elementary school.\n\nHence, I bought a lot of NO shares on Trump saying \"Tax Queen\"\n\nThe price was trading at 65/35 Yes/No, since Trump said it in his last rally (his last appearance was about remarks on the tax code, so it would be a no-brainer to bet on it)\n\n\n\n## Dangers and ad-hoc narratives.\n\nThe most common mistake I make *currently* as a bettor on mention market is bidding on markets with bad odds. Trump can say anything at a rally, you never know what comes on his mind.\nEven if the base rates for a specific word are low, betting against him saying something for a high price is unwise. I made this mistake today, in fact, betting against him saying \"Vance\".\nHe said it, and I lost $1000 since shares were going for 50c.\n\nIt's also important not to create ad-hoc narratives ie a forced thesis. For example, if Trump is speaking at some event in Pennsylvania, more likely than not, his remarks will follow previous rallies.\nThere's no need to bet harder on things like the economy and the border at bad odds - as previously mentioned, there are tons of opportunities to profit in MMs. Don't waste your money and over-bet.\n\nI've personally lost tons of money betting against Trump saying \"trans\", because I placed value in where exactly he was making the rally, and in what setting, instead of considering the nature of the remark,\nwhich is to rile up voters at the *end* of his rallies as part of his teleprompter speech.\n\nThese markets are competitive in nature; if you give out tips for free, markets will become more efficient and you will lose income opportunities.\n\nIn fact, I would argue that if newcomers or irrational bettors didn't exist, the odds would fall out of my favor and I would not be able to make any lucrative bets.\n\n\n### Low liquidity\n\nAfter making ~$8000 from various bets on mention markets, I found that many veterans began to stop betting on them.\nI guess it's because base rate bets kept failing and there was no empirical evidence that their strategy worked.\n\nThe viability of these markets will come into question throughout the next few months - will polymarket stop promoting them given how unfavorable they are to newcomers?",
